B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Nunyabidness,,,,,,3.0,"April 19, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"It was ok. That’s a problem for a three hour film that aspires to kick off a new franchise. This is at least the 7th Batman that we’ve introduced and it’s hard to take the character seriously at this point. DC continues to drive the comic into the ground through Wolverine like overexposure, but I still have faith in the films. A better editor would’ve helped immensely but the script was still flawed. The acting was wooden led by Robert Pattinson, who I think is a good actor. He clearly had seen all the Batman movies and did the requisite Batman voice like they all do. It’s his Bruce Wayne that’s the problem. Zoe Kravitz is competent, if unbelievable in throwing grown men around. Colin Farrell was ok, but the make up did all the heavy lifting. Jeffrey Wright and John Turturro absolutely mail it in. They both did the most generic versions of themselves. Paul Dano, on the other hand, continues to show that he might be the most talented American actor working today. The addition of Barry Keoghan really added a depth to the insanity of a Gotham villain. It makes the shot of venom that Batman takes less cringey when you realize Bane might be treated the same way. Technically, the film is marvelous. The cinematography and sound mix are top notch but not enough to save the film for me.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,James M,VINE VOICE,,,,,2.0,"June 13, 2022",United States,"This movie had its moments for one or two good action scenes and even some suspenseful dark almost horror like effects which is what I understand was part of the goal for Matt Reeves. However, when you think back about all of the stop start sub plots through the moments of confusion and endless drifting dialogue you realize why your foot has fallen asleep and you are imagining that George Clooney might show up eventually. This movie is full of overplayed and repeated action scenes and insipid emotional boredom and should have been an hour shorter to spare us the mental anguish. Robert Pattinson has never been able to do anything except smolder like an ageless vampire that laments his eternal damnation. Unfortunately Zoe Kravitz is not much better, getting by on her pouty lips and the ability to throw a cat suit about with finesse. What is truly sad is that the start of the movie with the story line around the Riddler and his evil plans to expose the corruption in Gotham actually began to develop in an interesting way. However the plot thinned after the first hour and a half and began to sour in the last hour as it culminated in the worst anticlimactic and ridiculous finale since Bane's attempt to destroy the city in The Dark Knight Rises. The plot soars and then dies, the acting is meh, the dynamic tension snaps all over the place and the Batsessories (which we all love so much) were so much less than anything else we have seen in the past. I gave this 2 stars because I liked one scene where Batman takes out the bad guys in the club near the end and the only light was given off by the sub machine gun fire. That scene alone was worthy of a replay. the rest of the movie should be taken behind the barn and put out of its misery.",,Zoolander and Twilight Made a Batman Movie,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF5OSUCPOCFV46QE6Y5KYKTNJ2PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DIPPR729397A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Rad Astronaut,,,,,,5.0,"May 15, 2022",United States,"Why is this the best Batman movie? The cinematography is INCREDIBLE. It is a master class in lighting and camera work. It gets visual inspiration from the comics, the video games, and movies like: Se7en, Taxi Driver, Silence of the Lambs, Prisoners and more. The acting is phenomenal. You forget it’s Pattinson, you forget it’s Colin Farrel, you forget it’s Paul Dano. Even Zoe Kravitz, who I think is mediocre, gives her best performance yet. Jeffry Wright is my favorite Gordon, which is hard because Gary Oldman was perfect. But the Batman & Gordon dynamic here is way more fun. The story is actually derived from actual comics (much of BATMAN EARTH ONE vol 2, with some The Long Halloween, Batman Year One, Court of Owls and Zero Year sprinkled in). The score is the best Bat music since 1989s Batman theme by Danny Elfman (except maybe Batman the Animated Series by Shirley Walker). It’s a dark, neo-noir detective story (Batman is the worlds greatest detective), and there’s real world and character building. Don’t listen to anyone about the costumes, they are directly inspired by the comics (Lee Bremejo’s art, as well as from Earth One and Year One), and meant to be more real and grounded (despite how everyone credits TDK for being “real”). This takes the comics and even inspo from the Adam West ‘66 Batman and makes it dark and gritty. Addressing the “wokeness”: yes there is one lame line about “white privileged a**holes”. It’s very out of place and I’m sure was demanded by Warner Bros & DC Comics to be shoehorned in. “Rich, corrupt a**holes” would have been more accurate and less insulting to a significant portion of the audience. BUT if you know how sickeningly woke those 2 companies are outside of this movie, this is NOTHING. And really, it doesn’t ruin anything. So Gordon is played by a black guy, it has zero affect on anything. He’s cast because he’s great in the role and there’s no hidden agenda in his character. Zoe looks exactly like Catwoman in YEAR ONE, so that point is also wrong. It’s not “liberal woke trash” as some crybabies are calling it. And trust me, I’d be the first to dismiss it if it was. THE ONLY criticism I have is that I wish they had committed to its grit and taken it 100% seriously, and made it rated R and gruesome… I know the studio wouldn’t allow that, but it feels very neutered when there’s all this implied gore we never see any blood. And there’s a couple kind of silly moments that are out of tone with how dark and serious a lot of it is. Again, ruins nothing for me… this is “in a perfect world” kinda stuff. Batman has to be accessible to young teens too, I get it… Haters gonna hate, this movie is THE BEST BATMAN.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Kindle Customer,,,,,,2.0,"April 23, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"Written by a massive Batman fan here. It will disappoint a lot of people. It is literally a movie mostly in darkness. And over 3 hours your eyes get tired. It is too slow for that style. It has good moments; there are some good scenes, especially if you are a fan. But definitely not enough. If you are not a fan, you probably won't make it though the movie. 95% shot in dark, rain, hard to see, and that takes a toll on your eyes after 3 hours. My best advice would be to watch this during the day, because you may get too tired or bored during the very long introduction part, which is over an hour. This 3 hour movie really needed an editor, very badly. Not much heroism. Some, but you could count on one hand. Riddler actually gets away with almost every crime, and this Batman is sadly ineffectual. It would be good balance for Batman to win a few more times, so that it was less monotous with the Riddler succeeding all the time. I am sorry for Robert Pattison fans, but I really don't see this a platform for a new storyline. I understand the strategy will be make a No-Man's Land for future episodes, but it is just too slow, too dark. Thank God I didn't watch at night... I read some people falling asleep in parts.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Revenant,,,,,,2.0,"April 28, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"Overall, this movie was average at best for me, I'd rank it 2.5 stars if possible. Some things I enjoyed was Batman actually being a skilled detective, Gotham felt like it's own city, it was mostly well acted, and the cinematography was well done. You can tell a lot of work went into the production of this movie. However, some aspects I didn't enjoy was Batman's fighting style, he just walks slowly towards bad guys and tanks bullets like Superman. I know this is ""early"" Batman but he still could have used stealth and fought smarter. Penguin was mostly a waste of a character, the only meaningful thing he does is correct Batman's Spanish to help solve a riddle, that's basically it. The Riddler's plans seem to contradict itself, one day he's targeting rich entitled people and the next day he targets the poor and a mayor who genuinely seems to be trying to help orphans and impoverished people, with a group of what appeared to be White nationalist militia members. If you add all this, with its bloated runtime, it makes the movie a bit of a slog to get through. Everyone in my theater was checking their phones for the time after about 2 hours and honestly they could have cut out at least 30 minutes of this movie without losing much. Bottom line, if you're a Batman fanboy/fangirl you'll probably think this movie is great. Otherwise, you'll notice a lot of flaws and this will ultimately feel lukewarm at best.",,"Great in some ways, worse in others",2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHTMJPBWQGNFWHOW24N3QXVS4HHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVJPVC6P7PPU9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,John E. Richardson,,Verified Purchase,,,,4.0,"July 13, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"The Batman is a very good movie overall but it falls short in one place and feels a little weird in another. It has a comic book feel without spelling it out but fans will see the connections between the narration, world and plot-lines. They chose to saturate the film in black, red and orange hues which helps set the tone and creates a different, more serious atmosphere. Where I thought it fell short is while they're unraveling the Riddler's manifesto, Batman is always seen in the suit but unnecessarily so. This works against him and in fact, everytime Batman is in the suit and there's a humanizing moment, it works against him in the same way Bane's mask prevented us from seeing Bane's true mad genius in Dark Knight Rises. My impression is that this movie was a big departure from the previous iterations of the cartoony Batman, world and characters. Perhaps it's this cartoony world that viewers have come to love about Batman, is that they've grown attached to it and why this more realistic version of Batman has garnered so much negative reviews but I really think they should stick with it but they should aim to be more practical in some places like Batman doesn't always need to be in a suit except for when he's going to fight bad guys. I'd like to say this DC Movie is in-line with the Batman world with the ultra-realistic Joker, starring J. Phoenix, and all future movies that will be made with that form of realism for Batman should have been made clear for viewers. I think one way they could have done that is to have Batman doing the detective work without wearing the suit, which is a major part of the first third of the movie. Same could have gone for Catwoman, when we do see her. That would allow viewers to get a feel for the new Batman and his new world of Gotham, in the same way that J. Phoenix did for Joker. This is a good Batman but I think they over did it with the emphasis of ""a Gotham city in peril"" and the psychopathic elements of the main Villain, which became tired and maybe even a little weird, mid-way through and I felt what was being rehashed didn't need further analysis - how everyone in Gotham seemed to be affected by what was reported on the news, The Carmine and Catwoman stuff, and the ""presence"" of Batman when he enters the scene, almost seeming intimidating in his suit. It would have been better if these scenes were R. Pattinson wearing casual clothing and a trench coat. Perhaps he would have a tattoo of the bat symbol or a bat on his wrist or something to give the viewer the needed connection. Everything else, the mafia world, Batman and Catwoman were more personal and evolved, and the martial arts choreography. The actors were great and I think they pulled off what they set out to do: a Batman that was more true to the comics that was a little over the top in a couple places.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,spychic,,,,,,2.0,"July 15, 2022",United States,"Batman has had amazing and so-so releases in the franchise over the years. So if you step in to do a Batman movie, you are trying to satisfy 50 years of fan base. This effort is not worthy of viewing let alone reviewing, but I hope to spare some of you the pain the I felt for 3 hours. To me, this was this was directorial malpractice. Nod to Zoe Kravitz who was a brief shining light in a very dark portrayal....literally the film was shot so dark & grainy that it was impossible to see the action shots. Just look at the images and you get the idea. [John Turturro was a fine mob boss as well]. But dark films are not artsy, they're just impossible to see. It doesn't help that this rendition wanted to blur the lines between good and evil, or make believe everyone has both in them and is ergo unpredictable. Despite some Hollywood heavy hitters, this movie was wrongly cast from top to bottom, weak screenplay that was poorly acted, it was unengaging and shortsighted, and clumsy directing - just a blunder no matter how you spin it. Sets were abysmal. Nothing was believable. It was close to a campy version without committing to it. I barely continued watching it. Such a sleeper, I did doze off and had to finish later. But I did not realize I had not finished that's how God awful it was - only when I clicked on it again I saw 38 minutes remaining. Lol. Truly the WORST cast Batman in the history of this franchise. Everyone compared Pattinson from Twilight to this role, as if he was good in that series. To me, Pattinson is the same flat performances in all his films, he's boring and unconvincing, I honestly do not see what ppl applaud about his performances. Even Michael Keaton played him better. Pattinson is a forgettable one note, monotone masked man. I hated it seeing what he did to the character and how is horrific portrayal plummeted an epic series. Pattinson is just not polished enough to pull off Bruce Wayne, let alone imparting the moral compass guiding him as the Batman. As Batman, he was this pensive & angry unhappy character who never smiled once in 3 hours. As much as I hate to say it Christian Bale presented a near riveting performance compared to this CRAP Batman. Utter CRAP of a movie start to finish. As another reviewer noted, not one single character is likeable - not the character, the ACTING. happy it was free, but can't get the time back. I do not know how it did so well on Rotten Tomatoes, but like this review, a movie that meanders this much is a let down to the is a let down to the multiplex spectators in search of adrenaline but who in it's stead got virtuosity.",,Worst Batman Movie Ever,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGHA7QOLBQAVJTFONDZZE3S7YXJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MWRTTZEU679N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

As far as Batman movies go, it was slow paced and rather dull. If you're hoping for a pretentious movie that aspires to be much more than a comic book adaptation, then this movie is probably just what you're looking for. If you're looking for a moody man in a Batman costume who rarely has anything even remotely like a real conversation with another human being, then this movie is for you. If you're hoping for an angry man filled with vengeance who is one step away from therapy or prison, then this Batman is for you. But if you're looking for a faithful adaptation of what Batman has been and meant to his loyal fans since the beginning, then this probably won't make you smile. As for those who rave about this adaptation of Batman, all I can say is that some people are much more easily impressed than others. This is a moody melodrama, and worth watching.

Batman is supposed to be a genius, an inventor, a great detective, fast, strong, etc. He is none of these things in this movie. His detective work is late on every move, so he shows up after the crime is either committed or being committed. He gets beat up in almost every fight. He has the weakest gadgets of any batman, ever. Ok, then you'll say maybe the story is good. The story drags all the way until the end with a lackluster, anticlimactic short fizzle which made think why the #311 did I waste 3 hours of my life on this.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Doesn't Matter,,,,,,5.0,"May 06, 2022",United States,"Best way to describe The Batman is that it's a brutal noir detective film that explores the city of Gotham and the terror of the Riddler. Real serial killer vibes from the Riddler: dorky socially inept loser with a dumb haircut. In regards to the complaints of ""woke""ness, there are only 2 things in this movie that are even related to race: 1. Jim Gordon and Catwoman are black. 2. ""White privilege"" is mentioned once. The irony is that this is very much a white privilege thing to complaint about: made up oppression to feel part of the group of minorities that actually experience racism from their government: the most odd application of FOMO I've ever seen or read. Racist people feel uncomfortable anytime racism is acknowledged so the fact that the #1 1 star review of this film solely complains about race, you can be assured that this movie has very few flaws. Complaints about ""woke""ness is made up nonsense. These are just racist complaints disguised as criticism. You will most likely enjoy this film unless the words ""white privilege"" used once in a 3 hour movie makes you feel uncomfortable.",,Great Detective Flick and Offends Republicans For Racial Reasons,10,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGD3XG726X6PRZXBPIQ3ZT3GKEJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TAEGZOTWGWPF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

Kind of a strange sentiment given how dark and shadowy everything looks, but once you see more of the wide FOV shots of the city (especially at dusk) you'll see what I mean. -Acting. I think just about everyone gave it their all on this one. Zoe Kravitz especially stole the show for me. I honestly thought her portrayal of Catwoman might be the most grounded interpretation of the character to date. The rest: -Pacing. This is a SLOW BURN in every sense of the phrase imaginable. There are of course some action sequences interspersed but it truly has the overall feel of a neo-noir detective film more than anything else. Some will absolutely adore that fact, I do not. -Story. Yet another ""The main villain is just someone who has a bone to pick with society and the ""system."" Seen it a thousand times before and while the execution isn't bad per sei, it doesn't offer enough twists on the formula to make it exciting or engaging in my opinion. -Batman/Bruce Wayne. While I think Pattinson did a fine job with what he was given, I really didn't care for the overall portrayal of the character. I know that Bruce Wayne is supposed to be capital D damaged and all, but its seems like the script forces the character to just simply be that way more than anything else. Let me just cap this all of by saying I have zero issues with other people really liking the hell out of this movie.

Matt Reeves has created a 'grittier' Batman and Robert Pattinson has done a phenomenal job in bringing this visualization of Batman to life. I thought that I'd never 'find' a better Batman after the exceptional Christopher Nolen and Christian Bale Trilogy - but - happily I was proven wrong. Zoë Kravitz is (my opinion) the best Catwoman by far with my rating her as a ten with next best - tossup between Eartha Kit and Julie Newmar - being a distant six. Paul Dano was a phenomenal Riddler. One does not have to 'act' crazy (Jim Carey) to be crazy. Jeffrey Wright grounded the whole movie in the gritty reality of a Police Lieutenant. With a movie being only as strong as its weakest character - each supporting character was perfectly cast - from Colin Farrell (four hours of makeup) as The Penguin to Peter Sarsgaard as District Attorney. Andy Serkisk perfectly 'underacted' his part as Alfred the Butler and provided a cohesion and authenticity to the plot.

Should have been called ""The Politically Correct Batman"". The movie is racist as hell. If you are white, you are corrupt. If you are black, like Catwoman or soon to be Commissioner Gordon, you are a good guy. Hey, what about Batman? Well, as Catwoman says, ""Bruce Wayne deserves to die because he is a product of white privilege."" What about Bruce's father, the millionaire or billionaire philanthropist shot down by a criminal in front of young Bruce? No, he was a corrupt politician who conspired with gangsters to kill his enemies. How about Bruce's mother. She was a nice woman. Nope. She was a mental patient, crazy as a loon. None of the villains, the Penguin or the Riddler look anything like any character that came before. They even change the Riddler's name, you know Edward or E Nygma, as in enigma as in puzzle, like a riddle. Guess the people who made the film didn't get it. Gotham is a dark place to live, and so is most of the photography in the film. It is probably also a lot cheaper to film action scenes where the audience can't see what going on.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,drqshadow,,,,,,3.0,"May 11, 2022",United States,"The tricky thing about reviving a long-lived franchise is, it’s always going to be compared to its predecessors. And, as the caped crusader goes, that history is awfully long and speckled. Tim Burton dealt with this when he helmed the 1989 iteration, dodging complaints that it was so fundamentally different from the Adam West camp of twenty years prior. Christopher Nolan fought an uphill battle in overcoming the damage inflicted by Joel Schumacher’s missteps. Now, in the wake of Ben Affleck’s turn beneath the cowl, Matt Reeves faces a different, but similar fight in justifying his vision of a spandex-clad detective in the crumbling urban decay. Reeves gives us a younger Batman, less seasoned and polished than the Kilmer/Clooney/Affleck years, but also not a rookie. This isn’t an origin story; this bat’s reputation has already been established in Gotham and he’s fostered a tenuous working relationship with certain members of the police force. He’s visible enough to draw the attention of a violent, counter-culture master criminal who addresses hints and clues like love letters and sprinkles them around his prolific crime scenes. But he lacks that grand, accomplished sense of supreme confidence: a patrolman who’s still learning his beat, he makes mistakes and takes lessons from them. Actually, he makes a *lot* of mistakes. This Batman is neither impervious in a fight nor unmatched in an intellectual sense. He often seems like he’s out of his depth, reacting and improvising to events beyond his control. That can be humanizing, but it also limits his aura. In terms of raw energy and dramatic appearances, this rendition ranks near the bottom. I might even call him dull. That’s a problem with the whole film, in fact. It has inspired and effective moments, isn’t demonstrably bad, but constantly feels clinical and lethargic. There’s very little dramatic spectacle, so I was never wowed. For all the boastful talk about emphasizing the detective aspect of his character, Batman himself doesn’t actually solve much. Alfred cracks most of the riddles, and when he’s eventually indisposed, the Riddler complains that his counterpart isn’t getting to the answers fast enough. Robert Pattinson’s take on the leading role is... okay. He looks the part while in costume, but often overacts, and his take on the brooding Bruce Wayne, as I’d feared, falls on the wrong side of the emo spectrum. Paul Dano’s Se7en-influenced Riddler is a fresh reimagining, but the conclusion of his story (or lack thereof) leaves an empty feeling. Hints and implications are dropped all over the place - about Gordon, the Penguin, Catwoman and other noteworthy rogues who shall remain nameless - but none go beyond the level of superficial winks. Batman and Robin’s Mister Freeze, for all his cheesy one-liners and bad costume effects, had a more cohesive, satisfying story than any of these characters. I don’t want to give the wrong impression. This isn’t a bad effort. I admire its influences, and its chutzpah for wearing them loudly on its chest. Gotham is dark and gritty, its corrupt politicians serving as an appropriate mirror to their real-life counterparts. The costumes and set designs look great. But, in a strange way, I feel that it tries too hard to match the execution of 2019’s Joker without really grasping what made that movie tick or why the two should be distinctive. Both are deathly serious, heavily visual, mood-reliant character pieces, but where Joker limits its iris to a small, tight group of characters, The Batman is overwhelmed by its cast. Joaquin Phoenix takes us on a private journey in the former film, and it’s meaningful when his arc is resolved. Pattinson, by comparison, never progresses beyond looking mopey in the rain.",,"Suitable Grim and Somber, The Latest Batman Lacks Panache",,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFO2RDMKUTXC3M7C3T2UVFANWQVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RB81MH4ZO0VN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Brandon Pawlicki,,,,,,5.0,"April 23, 2022",United States,"This iteration of Batman does many things that I always wished the others had done. Firstly, it treats itself like a film rather than a superhero film. Even Nolan's trilogy, while it did a good job and I do greatly enjoy those films, felt a little hammy here and there and just didn't pack the cinematic punch that I tend to go for. This is a grim, slow burn murder mystery set in the Batman universe. It takes its time and lets things breathe, and this works wonderfully both for the characters and the overall atmosphere. Next, as mentioned, it's grim. What I've always loved about Batman is that, while the campier elements are indeed fun from time to time, the character and the lore lends itself so well to a more eerie horror based approach and I don't think we've really gotten that before, at least not for a whole film. The opening maybe half hour-ish is a perfect reflection of all of this. It sucks you in, gives you tingles down your spine, and doesn't let go. Yes, it's a longer film, and for me, at times that runtime is felt, though by the end I still wanted more. It sorta feels like you're binging new episodes of a favorite show and it's upsetting that there's only so much to chew on. Without rambling on for too long, I was initially just lukewarm on this the first time I saw it; I loved most of it, but the last act had issues for me; though having seen it a few more times, I've fallen in love with the whole film and I'm very excited to see where the director's trilogy plan goes. I'd also like to take a moment to show appreciation to the decision of showcasing a very lost, angry Bruce Wayne that hasn't figured out his playboy persona yet. It's something new to see him so stuck in his trauma that he just can't, and doesn't care to, be anything but Batman. It'll be interesting to see him grow that persona in future films... and there better be a lot of them, because this was just great. If I HAD to point at a negative, I'd say that I've got two and they're really just nitpicks on my end. The main villain had some moments in here that really made me crack up the first time I saw the movie and these moments still kinda get me. That's not to say the villain or the actor was bad. They're actually great. My sense of humor is just off the wall and certain mannerisms the character had just got me. And I feel like the movie reshot a few bits to be less violent for the PG-13 rating. When it's dark, it's REALLY dark, so you can spot a few scenes here and there where it's clear they were initially going to do something heavier, but backed off for the final product; a big one for me was a moment where Bats pretty much beat a guy to a pulp and when you see the result it almost looks like he'd only been slapped around a bit rather than... you know... having his face broken. But that's really it. Otherwise it's great and you should all see it. More please!",,A Grim Detective Tale.

I watched this again when it came to streaming services after it left the theater and I am glad I saw it again to see other things I did not notice the first time. I could watch this over and over and never get tired of it. Colin Farrell was the best penguin also, who really made the character convincing. Zoe Kravitz was absolutely the best Catwoman yet.

I thought it was...just OK. Robert Patterson did a great job playing a different take on Bruce Wayne, almost Emo, and an amateur Batman with early experience. Certainly, a different experience overall. The villains were fine, most notedly The Penguin (played my Colin Farrell -- who should be nominated for an award), The Riddler (though a nut job, parallel of today's mass shooters), and Catwoman (who was borderline mundane and didn't impress too much). The ending scene, which I won't give away, was a bit of a letdown and further cheapened the movie. Bad performance and what sounded like a poor fan-effort impersonation. Very cringy. And lastly, the movie ran too long (177 minutes) which seemed unnecessary. We'll see what the sequel brings.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,RDD,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,Verified Purchase,,,,5.0,"May 25, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"Matt Reeves’ 2022 film, “The Batman,” loosely adapts Jeph Loeb and Tim Sales’s story, “Batman: The Long Halloween.” It begins with the Batman (Robert Pattinson) in his second year of crime-fighting, putting this story in a chronologically similar setting as the comic while also referencing events from Frank Miller’s “Batman: Year One,” which itself inspired “Batman: Begins.” This film references events familiar to Batman fans without re-treading familiar territory. It introduces a different version of the Riddler, inspired by Zodiac, who targets corrupt political officials in the increasingly economically-stratified and corrupt Gotham. Pattinson’s Batman gets to demonstrate his detective skills, following clues and trying to figure out the crime, though the nature of the story means that he only catches up to the Riddler (Paul Dano) toward the end. Assisting him are Alfred Pennyworth (Andy Serkis), GCPD Lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), and Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz). They face the Gotham mob, represented by Oswald “Oz” Cobblepot/Penguin (Colin Farrell) and Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Selina Kyle’s story with Falcone further draws upon the events of Loeb & Sales’s “Long Halloween” and “Catwoman: When in Rome.” Set early in the Batman’s career, this story shows a Batman who has not yet developed the Bruce Wayne persona that other actors use to show the dichotomy between Wayne/Batman. Reeves also balances the desire for gritty realism with more comic book elements, creating realistic gadgets and villains for Batman who are just across the line into fantasy and don’t use exposition to firmly ground them in reality. In this, Reeves captures the best parts of the comics he references while showing the influence of Christopher Nolan’s grounded “Dark Knight” trilogy. Furthermore, each actor perfectly fits their part and brings something that fills out the world or advances the story. The score by Michael Giacchino works particularly well to build the films atmosphere. Finally, this is one of only three live-action Batman films in which Batman realizes he can be more than a Dark Knight and symbol of fear (the other two are “Batman Forever” and “The Dark Knight Rises”). As the first in a planned series, this realization opens up interesting story possibilities for the forthcoming sequels. This Blu-ray/DVD combo pack includes the film on one disc of each as well as an extra Blu-ray disc containing the bonus features. These include a making-of documentary, deleted scenes with director Matt Reeves’s commentary, a breakdown of the car-chase sequence, a look at the creation of this iteration of the Batman compared to his predecessors, a look at how Zoë Kravitz got into character as Catwoman, and more.",,A Great New Take on the Batman Mythos!,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGEKA6WODQNV3G5QBLHTEBDDZNQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBY7DF83I0WJT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,jww,TOP 1000 REVIEWER | VINE VOICE,,,,,4.0,"April 16, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"irector Matt Reeves definitely leaves an impression with this. The opening, introducing Gotham and Batman (played by Robert Pattinson) is just an excellently realized work of cinema. Visually, The Batman really captures the feel of being in a city with some excellent scenery ranging from dirty streets to the fancy but antiquated areas. Bruce Wayne's place in particular, is a fantastically busy neo-gothic looking affair. Also, Reeves really went out of his way to make the city look populated. Has some of the most crowded extras scenes I've seen in a while. Must've been quite an endeavor to put together. This also has one of the most ambitious car chases put to screen. I've never seen a movie have a car chase in such congested, traditional city traffic. In fact, it feels a little too real like actual traffic accident situations and took me out of it a little. Also, this is the one scene where you question Batman's methods. This has excellent lightning with a lot of good use of city lights. I can often be be annoyed by films that are too darkly shot, but this one always feels like the shadows are always in the right place, accentuating the scenes. Michael Giacchino's soundtrack really helps the film's mood; very sweeping and moving. This film skips an origin story for or introduction to Batman. I think this might be the closest a live-action film has come to matching the feel of the comics (at least the more recent ones.) You just jump in with Batman, who's already been operating for two years and has already established a relationship with Lt. Gordon (Westworld's Jeffrey Wright). No live-action Batman film has ever focused on the detective side of the character as this. This is a straight-up mystery film mixed with a serial killer film and a crime film. The story, aided by the atmosphere of the piece, will keep your eyes glued. However, when you get down to it the film's basic concepts, the corruption and themed serial killer parts, aren't that original. Heck, the movie even reuses a couple plot points from the comics. This also repeats the idea from the first two Nolan films of Batman fighting against the established criminal underworld who have Gotham in their grip. Between this, the Nolan films, Gotham (the show if you're not familiar), and some of the animated films, including the recent The Long Halloween, I'm so tired of Batman stories reusing the same mob figures like Carmine Falcone (here played by John Turturro) and Sal Maroni. Do you realize that there have been two live-action movies with Carmine Falcone and none with the likes of such villains as Clayface, Mad Hatter, or Dr. Hugo Strange? If you ask someone for their top ten or five Batman villains, they're not going to say Carmine Falcone. Enough with the flipping Carmine Falcone and other mobsters stories, already!!! You're not paving any new ground!!! The movie didn't need to be three hours long. They could've easily cut down on the number of characters. Though I do like Zoe Kravitz's Catwoman and she has great chemistry with Batman, her subplot could've easily been cut. Understand that this is probably the darkest mainstream superhero movie put to screen. Things can get pretty unsettling, like even more unsettling than some of the Joker moments from The Dark Knight. (From a technical standpoint, I'm weirdly impressed with how they pulled this off with a PG-13 rating.) Cast is great in this. Though you may argue that they make Batman a little too brooding and his Bruce Wayne appearance a little too emo, Pattinson does one of the best jobs of portraying a human Batman who is determined to do his all against terrible odds and is an empathetic man beneath his stolid persona. Wright is definitely one of the Best Gordons with THE best relationship with a Batman. He's kinda Batman's sidekick in this. Andy Serkis, who I don't think anyone suspected would be playing the role, is one of the best Alfred Pennyworths, though he doesn't get much screent ime. He's become so known for motion capture performances, it's nice to see how good a performer he is just by himself. Recommend. I wouldn't rank this as high as the Nolan trilogy or even Batman Returns. I felt those movies did a better job with plotting and characters. Also, the length, heavy tone, and the fact that the plot points aren't that original, hurts replay value. Still, this is a very strong, visually impressive, well-acted entry that does catch your attention.",,One of the best directed Batman films (though the plot can be a little derivative.),7,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEECFYRSDPYS4WNWXWOX3T46LRXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXD5PCM6Y4NX5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,SuckaMC,,,,,,5.0,"April 23, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"The noir elements of The Batman aren't just relegated to visuals, the dialog and story itself is very noir detective. Some of these lines could be in a Humphrey Bogart flick. While some will find it boring, to me it gives the film a sort of cool sheen to it. I am Batman comic fan for most of my life and so it's refreshing to finally see a proper detective story in live action. The more grounded version actually refers a lot to the Batman Earth One series, which to me is also cool. Some of the 'emo' here can be hokey. ""I don't care about THAT"" is about as corny as Anakin Skywalker's ""I hate sand"" quote. But it's really not distracting. And the absolute best part of this film is that is, indeed, THE Batman. It is not 45 minutes of Bruce Wayne figuring out what he wants to be. Yes it's long, it gets slow in some parts, but it's probably the best Batman next to Nolan's trilogy and 1989. Zack Snyder fans will probably hate it, since there isn't some cartoony CGI battle at the end. If I had to critique the story, while it's a noir thriller/detective story through and through, it's not a mystery per se. As the pieces fall into place, there's no grand twist, nothing to solve. You know who the villain is, it's a matter of the story letting itself unfold to understand why they are doing what they do.",,Noir Batman Will Not Be Everyone's Cup Of Tea,16,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6OHVM44CIFNA7YAI6ZHCNX232Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KSV8OI55FAD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

For starters you gotta appreciate the more in depth detail on this incarnation of Batman to actually comprehend it. We've never seen this much detail in a live version of this character EVER. It has all the elements mixed into one. People who say it was a bad movie or it was boring are the same people who are use to only straight up action films or short time and attention span 10 to 20 second videos. They have no clear understanding of a film with mystery and suspense elements. Which is fine we all have different tastes. Problem is that's why if they tried watching brilliant creative minds in films made by lets say Alfred Hitchcock, they would get bored over it. Zero lack of and appreciation for the ART of film. Because at the end of the day that's what film is, ART. And that's what we have here with this movie. Just my 2 cents on the matter. If you're a true fan of Batman you'll love this film.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,James Morris,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,Verified Purchase,,,,5.0,"May 25, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"First of all, I normally do not review Special Features on a Video Release. I am usually interested in only the film itself, and I must admit that I rarely view the Special Features on Home Video. The Batman is a wonderful exception. Each of the Special Features on the 4k / Blu Ray Edition of The Batman were positively thrilling. I received the package today, and spent over two hours viewing the Special Features. The multiple mini-Documentaries - one of which is over fifty minutes long - did a superb job of explaining the Director's and Writer's vision behind The Batman. And the deleted scenes, which can be viewed with or without the Director’s commentary, are every bit as interesting as promised. As for the film, well, today I saw it for the third time – once in a Theatre on Opening Day, once on HBO Max and now on my very own 4k Disc. This version of Batman, THE Batman, is a take on the character that has not been explored in any Film before. As illustrated in the numerous One and Two Star reviews here, this iteration of the character has more than its share of detractors. To those who are not happy with The Batman I say, walk away and wait - there will undoubtedly be other versions of Batman in the future, and hopefully one more to your liking. As for me, I loved every satisfying minute of it, and I expect to view it many more times. I have a friend whose opinion I value greatly, who saw it eight times in a Movie Theatre. I don’t really know what some people were expecting. Batman has had so many different treatments that I marvel that the creative team on this film were able to come up with such fresh ideas. This is not The Dark Knight (thank goodness) and not something that Tim Burton would dream up. This is a wholly new and altogether unique take on a Vigilante / Hero that has been done to death. Yes, it’s the darkest, most humorless, grim version of The Batman ever done. Bravo! I found so much in this film to be drawn into, and so much to analyze, that even after three viewings, I haven't quite been able to absorb it all. The plot twists had my brain spinning, trying to keep up. This Batman is not for stupid people. And with each separate viewing, I experienced some of the greatest terror even unleashed by a villain in a Superhero movie. I grew up reading Detective Comics in the 1960’s and, director Matt Reeves and lead actor Robert Pattinson have given us a story that fits in with my understanding of the character more than any other film or TV take on Batman that I’ve ever seen. Not that any of the past films were bad (ok, a few were awful) but this version brings out an aspect of The Batman that I have always treasured. To me, Batman was always a serious Comic Book combination of three things 1) The World’s Greatest Detective 2) The World’s Greatest Acrobat and 3) The World’s Greatest Martial Arts Expert. It is the Detective portion of the character that has been ignored up ‘til now, and that has always been my favorite feature of Batman. This film brings that quality to the forefront. In addition, many of those who didn’t like it seem to overlook that this Batman is in his second year as a crimefighter, still very young, still somewhat naïve, and still finding his way. The Police and Gotham's Citizens have not yet learned to trust him. In one already iconic scene, The Batman comes to the rescue of a straphanger being terrorized by a gang of young punks. After the bad guys are defeated, the victim continues to cower and says to The Batman, ""Please don't hurt me"". That is a brilliant way to illustrate how green The Batman is in this Film. Mr. Reeves has brought us a tale that is definitely noir, definitely dark, serious and, above all, creepy, thanks to the brilliant portrayal of The Riddler by Paul Dano. Mr. Dano is an actor I have had my eyes on for several years now, ever since his magnificent characterization of a sleezy Preacher in There Will Be Blood. The storyline is twisted and The Riddler's appearances terrifying. I found myself on the edge of my seat wondering what surprise was coming next, and just when I thought it was resolved we get another twist and then another. The two-hour and fifty-six minute run time flew by for me, and I’m really sorry that so many people didn’t seem to get it. Over at IMDB, where good films get taken far more seriously than they do by the “Critics” at Amazon, The Batman has an average rating of Eight out of Ten Stars. Go figure. This is not a Batman for fans of Harry Potter and Jurassic Park. The cast is uniformly wonderful and everyone involved in this film has given their all. Besides Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Andy Serkis, and Peter Sarsgaard, even the actors playing minor parts were all outstanding. I could write for hours and not get tired of praising the many achievements of this serious, refreshing Film, but for now let me just say that I, for one, highly recommend The Batman and my rating is a full Five Stars.

So I have no idea which version of Batman is the most authentic. It seems Batman is a blank canvas with everything from Adam West, to the great looking but horribly bloody Gotham TV show. While not truly film noir, this version of Batman is just gorgeous. Chicago has never looked worse! Like Blade Runner or even Nightmare Alley, you could watch The Batman with the sound off and it would still be beautiful. So many movies try to do this but can't, either due to lack of skill or lack of money. The Edward Hopper coffee shop scene was a beauty, as was Batman leading the people with a torch. The performances were good. Batgirl was a little weak, but John Turturo was sensational. I thought 3 hours would be torture, and it was long, but not by that much. And never once did I have to wonder who was doing what, or why. The only misstep, I thought, was the bit with the thumb, because you could see it coming, so it belonged in a much dumber movie. I suppose, if you were expecting Frank Gorshin, or more violence than John Wick, all this might be boring, but I really enjoyed it.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Mike S.,VINE VOICE,Verified Purchase,,,,5.0,"May 29, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"The Batman is yet another live-action take on Batman, yet one that is much different than what has come before. This film forgoes doing the origin story that has been done multiple times and jumps into Batman's second year as a vigilante. He is working with Lieutenant Gordon who brings him in to investigate a series of murders involving high-ranking Gotham officials, with the killer leaving riddles for Batman at the scene of each kill. The story is much more of an origin story for the rogue's gallery of villains and is adapted heavily from the year one and year two comics. The casting of the movie was (as always) controversial with Robert Pattinson playing Bruce Wayne/Batman, Zoe Kravits playing Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Paul Dano playing The Riddler, Collin Farrell playing Penguin, Jeffrey Wright playing Jim Gordon, Andy Serkis playing Alfred, and John Turturro playing Carmine Falcone. Of course, Pattinson's casting was a subject of much debate (as has most every casting choice for Batman since Keaton landed the role in the late 1980s). Pattinson was best known for his roles in the Twilight series (which even he admits were not that good) and as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter. I think most people complaining about his casting either were not aware of his other work, in which he has shown his acting chops or just liked to complain. But, he, and the rest of the cast, did a great job with their characters. Farrell was unrecognizable both in look and voice as Penguin (he was really just a secondary character in the movie) and Dano, who to this point was probably best known as a side character in the movie Girl Next Door and from his role in There Will be Blood, was awesome as The Riddler. And, Barry Keoghan was great in his minute or so at the end clearly playing an early version of The Joker (but credited as being the unseen Arkham inmate). The movie looks and sounds great in UHD. The 4K set is actually a three-disc set. The UHD disc and one of the regular Blu-Ray discs just has the movie itself, and the second regular Blu-Ray disc has all the special features and extras. The extras include several short behind-the-scenes featurettes that range from a couple of minutes to about 10 minutes in length. The main feature is an almost hour-long making-of documentary which spans pretty much the entire filming process and shows how the covid pandemic really impacted how the film was made. Then there are a couple of deleted scenes that you can watch with or without director commentary. Overall, the movie is great. I do think it is a bit long and could have been cut down for time. That said, I think most of the scenes that did end up in the final cut of the film worked, so aside from a couple of scenes at the very end of the film, I think it would have been hard to pick what to remove. I like the fact that Batman is not yet fully formed in this movie and he is still trying to figure out how to be Batman, without really caring about being Bruce Wayne. It is also interesting to see him operate out in the daylight while literally carrying the Batsuit around in a duffel bag slung over his shoulder. The movie has a feel that is much more similar to Nolan's trilogy of movies than it does to the Burton or Schumacher movies, without being a carbon copy of what Nolan did with his. The movie has an old-school film noir crime/detective story feel to it and is extremely well-acted. Definitely worth watching and investing in the disc for those who still get the physical discs.",,Great,3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHCKL4T4OM63G4T3MSCQ5H4G2WYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17Q7S80JRJELB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,John S Harris,,,,,,5.0,"April 18, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"**I would advise against watching the 4K UHD version of this film (either the digital download or the 4K UHD disc) on a 4K TV. Watching the 4K UHD download/disc on a regular (non-4K) TV is fine, as is watching a regular (non-4K UHD) presentation on a 4K TV. But don't watch a 4K UHD copy on a 4K TV.** The 4K UHD transfer is sharp and immaculate, and therein lies the problem. A moody, noir thriller should be have a visual tone that matches the film’s mood. That visual tone is almost totally lost in 4K UHD format because the image is brighter and full of significantly more visual detail. It’s like walking through a haunted house with the lights on. What you gain in clarity and detail you lose in atmosphere. The sharper the details the more it resembles the dreaded “TV soap opera effect”. It really does feel like you’re watching television instead of a movie. I even read one reviewer's comment that the image is so hyper-realistic it looks like you're immersed in in and are watching a play. 4K UHD, which can make concert videos and nature documentaries look stunning and awesome, doesn’t always lend itself to narrative fiction. The increased sharpness and brightness blurs the line between fiction and “you are there” reality. And it’s pretty disconcerting to watch. I saw “The Batman” four times in the theaters and the visual presentation was as perfect as it could be. But watching it at home on 4K UHD is a major shift, and not for the better. I’m hoping the regular Blu-ray with its content-appropriate resolution will more closely match the theatrical experience when the Blu-ray is watched on a 4K TV. When I watched the 4K UHD digital download on my phone and on my iPad - neither of which has a 4K screen - everything looked fine. There’s nothing even remotely scary or intense about “The Batman” in 4K UHD. The image is too bright and pristine. It kills the mood. Like I said, it’s like touring a haunted house with the lights on. You can see too much. There’s nothing to set the mood of dread or tension. Bottom line: the human eye does not see the real world in hyper-realistic UHD, which is why seeing narrative fiction in UHD looks a little ""off"" sometimes. Your brain knows you're watching fiction but your eyes are trying to tell your brain you're watching real life. So it makes for a disconcerting experience. If you want to buy the 4K UHD version of this film, i think you'll enjoy it more if you view it on a screen that is NOT scaled for 4K UHD resolution. I kid you not. Again, this is mainly relevant for fiction. If you're watching nature documentaries like ""Planet Earth"", actual real-life events like ""Free Solo"" or ""The Barkley Marathons"", or a well-shot concert video that wasn't shot in soft diffusion like David Mallet used to do, then 4K material on a 4K UHD TV is fantastic!! But for narrative fiction please be more careful.",,"Great movie, but do NOT watch in 4K UHD.",10,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEQGAVRTJRIRLYEX2HC4XLC2QYHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R327ZUXEHCNVSF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

This movie's special. This was a take on the Detective line of Batman comics. So, it's not just about finding a bad guy and battling him. It's about finding who the bad guy is and solving the mystery. He didn't rely on technology from military contractors or his money as much; instead relying on his own intellect and grit. Think Seven mixed with the Dark Knight. I can't remember the last movie that held my attention so completely throughout. Every transition, camera angle, focus, music choice, everything just hit their marks. It felt like we were on the journey with the Batman.

I have learned from past experiences that doing that will leave me with nothing but disappointment. Now that said... The film itself felt slow, but the story was very good. I enjoyed it immensely. The choice for Robert Pattinson was interesting. After so many years of Twilight hate and memes I wasn't expecting him to have a good performance. I was wrong. He did the character well. The choice for makeup and hair and such for him though wasn't what I would have chose. The batsuit looked great, it meshed well with the way the surroundings looked. And personally I feel like the Batmobile was the most realistic one yet outside of the one from the 1966 show and films. Its proof not everything has to be super flashy. Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman was good. She did well in my opinion. The choice to go with a stocking cap for her ""helmet"" though was bleh. Jeffery Wright as Gordon was a good choice. Sadly I don't know much about him aside he was in one of the Hunger Games movies. Overall the film was good. I look forward to seeing if they do anything else with this particular version of Batman.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Tim Savage,,Verified Purchase,,,,5.0,"July 08, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"Most superhero movies, especially the bigger IP's, are power fantasies. There's nothing wrong with that, it can be cathartic to watch someone beat up the bad guys and live vicariously through these heroes we grew up reading and or watching. The Batman (or Battinson as I like to call it) starts off this way, but we learn pretty quickly that there's a whole lot more to the film than seeing the bad guys get their comeuppance. There's a surprising level of introspection in this power fantasy. When both the heroes and villains use violence as a way to achieve their goals, what separates them really? I suppose if you just want to disconnect from reality for nearly three hours and avoid introspection this could be a turn off, but I don't think we can give the Nolan/Bale movies the distinction of being the most ""realistic"" Batman movies anymore. Those films are still great, but they're very comic book-y compared to this movie. Technically speaking the direction, acting, cinematography, sound effects, and score are fantastic. As a music fan, sometimes using popular music in a film can ruin it for me and make me roll my eyes. I actually started off a little lukewarm on the film's use of Nirvana's ""Something in the Way,"" but it really grew on me. The tone just fits. Pattinson as Battinson (couldn't help myself) works really well for the film. Batman is not well psychologically speaking, and he was absolutely perfect in the role of an unhinged vigilante with good intentions. I was concerned at first, as I only knew him from Twilight, but this guy has a lot of range as we can see in movies like The Lighthouse. The Riddler is more threatening than he's ever been, and though some people like to drag Paul Dano on his performance with the mask off, I think it fits. His goals are sympathetic to anyone disappointed in politicians and their broken promises, but he is also not psychologically sound enough to take the law into his own hands. The Batman/Riddler dichotomy is the same point The Dark Knight tried to make with Heath Ledger's legendary Joker, that they're two sides of the same coin, but this film pulled it off better to me because it actually made Batman question himself and change his outlook. Which is what growth looks like. Bale's Batman didn't really grow much throughout that series, and I'd argue that he's the most boring character in the series. Batman films tend to focus more on the villains than Batman himself, as he's mostly just stoic and one-note. This is a true Batman film, and I can't wait to see more from Matt Reeves and Robert Battinson.",,My personal favorite take on Batman.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,F. C. Schaefer,,,,,,5.0,"April 18, 2022",United States,"Well, the Snyderverse never really took off, and that’s a shame, so it is back to square one, and that means we get a whole new incarnation of DC’s most fascinating top tier super hero, Batman. This new version is directed by Matt Reeves, who directed CLOVERFIELD, a film of which I am a big fan, and is simply titled THE BATMAN. This time the Caped Crusader is going solo as there is not a mention of Superman, Wonder Woman, The JLA, or any other hero of the DC universe. Reeves’ film is a stripped down, grim and gritty saga set in Gotham City very early in the career of millionaire Bruce Wayne turned vigilante. It’s dark, literally, as most scenes take place at night, and black it the primary color. The skies always appear to be cloudy, the better for the bat signal to appear, and rain is falling half the time. This is another film that can be considered a literal descendant from Martin Scorsese’s TAXI DRIVER, not to mention Ridley Scott’s BLADE RUNNER. I thought other primary influences are David Fincher’s SEVEN, and James Wan’s SAW. There’s also a noticeable lack of humor in the script, which portrays Gotham as an urban hellhole, where street thugs prey almost at will upon citizens while organized crime gets rich off dealing drugs with the help of a police force mostly on the take. Some will find all this darkness, literal and otherwise, to be pretentious, but I think it succeeds by building a world where a masked vigilante is the only salvation. Where I also think THE BATMAN succeeds amazingly well is when it leans into the Caped Crusader as “the world’s greatest detective.” The basic plot of the film concerns the pursuit of The Riddler—the film’s chief Big Bad—a serial killer targeting the mayor, the chief of police, the district attorney, and other authority figures in Gotham while leaving riddles at each crime scene for Batmen. These riddles are clues to not only the motive behind The Riddler’s reign of terror, but to the larger corruption in Gotham, a big picture that comes to include the Wayne family. Along the way, Batman encounters Selena Kyle, a hostess at an underworld controlled night club who moonlights as the burglar known at Catwoman; club operator Oswald Cobblepot, the gimp also known as The Penguin; Carmine Falcone, the crime boss everyone works for in Gotham. Helping Batman is detective Jim Gordon, his only ally on a wary and suspicious police force; this is first Batman film to show a fractious relationship between Gotham’s champion vigilante and law enforcement, and it adds to the film enormously. Lurking behind them all is a masked murderer who shows no mercy. There are a couple of well staged set piece action scenes. The best is a terrifically staged car chase between the Batmobile and a fleeing Penguin through oncoming traffic, and an encounter in a pitch dark hallway between Batman and some mobsters where the only illumination comes from the flash of automatic weapons firing. How is Robert Pattinson in the title role? He’s moody and broody enough to make a good and imposing Batman, which is necessary to make the film work, but his Bruce Wayne (who doesn’t get much screen time) needs way more fleshing out. Pattinson never smiles, which suits the film’s mood, but he does have real chemistry with Zoe Kravitz’s Catwoman, whose strong presence is a good balance with the Caped Crusader. Paul Dano’s Riddler doesn’t show his face until late in the film, but he makes a quit convincing psycho. Jeffrey Wright is a commanding Jim Gordon, while John Turturro is appropriately slimy as Falcone. My favorite is an unrecognizable Colin Ferrall as The Penguin, a member of the rogue’s gallery we haven’t seen onscreen since Danny DeVito’s grotesque in Tim Burton’s BATMAN RETURNS, and of the two, I much prefer Ferrall’s snarling bottom feeding criminal. Andy Serkis is quite capable as Alfred. And that is the Carver twins as the muscles who man the door at Cobblepot’s club. In a good film, the musical score is a character in its own right, and that can truly be said about Michael Giacchino’s work on THE BATMAN, especially in the way he works in Nirvana’s “Something in the Way.” At three hours, THE BATMAN is a sit. I think a good twenty minutes could easily have been cut from it. As in all comic book films, there is some exposition heavy dialogue that can be clunky. And I can easily see where this film is not every Batman fan’s cup of tea; it has way much more in common with Todd Phillips’ THE JOKER than anything made by Burton or Joel Schumacher, not to mention the comic books written by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. Batman has been around a long time now, and when it comes to adaptations, I think we’ve gotten the hero to fit the times, starting with Adam West on the old ‘60s TV show, a series steeped in Boomer irreverence, to the Super Friends of long ago Saturday mornings, to the films of Burton, Schumacher, Christopher Nolan, and Zach Snyder, which in some way reflected the pop culture and the social tensions of past decades. Now Matt Reeves gives us a Batman for the 2020s. I like the way he leans into the theme of a city where the citizens have been betrayed and exploited by the elites and those in authority, and now the monsters they’ve created are coming for them. I’ll concede that it’s not an original approach, but it is a strong one with many storytelling possibilities. And where does this incarnation of Batman go next? Well, I was most intrigued by a brief appearance by Barry Keoghan, credited only as “unseen Arkham prisoner,” who tells The Riddler that people love a comeback story, and who has a very distinctive laugh.",,A Batman for the '20s.,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEALSLZB7SYRALDIAJYZQXY6OBFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L41SA6YNMRGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

Granted it is another reboot and restart of the franchise we have seen many times, but they have managed to bring something different to the story. I like how they introduced some of Batman’s most known villains. Colin Farrell is not recognizable as the Penguin, which says in itself how good the makeup job and acting was.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,TheUniqueNerd,,,,,,3.0,"May 01, 2022",United States,"DC proves to be a force that makes films for its directors, or should I say directors make films for themselves. To me that's the best thing to do with adaptations, even if its like Noah, the biblical tale that came out a few years back. That said: This is very flawed. Pattinson is probably the worst Bats, yet an even worse Bruce. Yet he made it work? Yes he did. The script was great though, and its like I always said even with the terribad Clooney, if he'd had this script I'd gave it 3 stars, most likely, too. Actors can only do whats on paper, for better or worse. The direction was,.....bad. He (Reeves) tried to hard to top Nolan's work, of the dark Bat's world. Snyder on the other hand copied, yet added. And that worked better. I am not a Nolan fan outside his Batman films and a couple others, but he his consistently fair to his work and motivation toward film making. Whereas Matt Reeves isn't, and unless he ups his game next time the 2nd Batman could be the polar opposite of what Nolan did with his 2nd outing in Batman, The Dark Knight. The tone however yes, tone is different then direction. Anyway, it was great. Yet as a Superman/Wonder Woman fan side of DC its hard for me to like tremendously dark superheroes, except ummmmm, Nolan's Batman. So I guess yeah I got in that trap. :) Overall tho this wasn't ""bad"" it just needs dissection as it is crafted differently then most tentpole films. Even superhero ones. You know, I don't mean to directly compare DC to Marvel but it reminded me of the much, disliked, if not hated Eternals. Which I, Loved! Mostly because it did the opposite of what I dislike from Marvel, and made something very different. The Batman shouldn't have taken a Twisting Nether Nolan approach, for me I want a Batman Beyond film.....just sayin'. Again as stated in the subject, I will BUY this, I will rewatch it, and see if I enjoy it better. I collect movies, so that's easy. Also the color grading was nice so I'm interested to see what my 4k TV can make it look like. Don't be shy, watch this, and try to enjoy. Just note, its nothing brand new, or even Like New. Instead a try to hard kinda old. Thanks for reading.",,Good. Flawed. May re-rate after a 2nd viewing on Blu-Ray 4k.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Max Hudson,,Verified Purchase,,,,3.0,"May 31, 2022",United States,"I love DC and Marvel movies. This movie reflects the dark murderous days we live in. If you were a kid wouldn't you want to see this new Batman movie? What if violence and language kept that poor kid away!? If you expect a super hero like the comics, or the classic Christopher Reeves movies, you may be dissapointed. This reality-based Batman was made to be believable, but so is the violence. It is a dark movie missing the fantacy side of Batman, but is still exciting under all the dark drama. The car chases are really very cool, granted, I wish I had that Batmobile. Please understand, I'm old enough to have read comics in the early 60's! And I remember waiting for the 1st Adam West series to start! I even had a Batman rain hood-cape that came off the mask as a kid. So my fandom goes way back. But I never thought I'd hear the F word in a Batman movie! Was the movie good? Yeah, it was good. Could it have been better? I would have scribbled out the part with the internet brain-washed serial killers.. 😜Cause lately, there is enough of that in the news. A little TOO real, guys..This ain't John Wick! Hah, More gagets, though please, more cliff- hangers in the sequel, please. Cat Woman was great! Hope we see her again or maybe Batgirl. Robin? But Dad's be warned of the rating, but I hope you all really do enjoy it anyway. (Marvel take note. And Captain America.. You go ahead and tell them.. Tell them all, not that they'll listen..

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,David Swan,,Verified Purchase,,,,5.0,"May 26, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"The Batman is the first Batman movie, starting with the 1989 version, that I did not see in the theaters. There were a few different reasons but the final nail in the coffin was probably the nearly three hour running time. That running time is going to be pretty rough if you’re not loving Matt Reeves directing style because this movie moves SLOW. There is a scene early on where The Batman is at a crime scene and it’s clear that Reeves is in no hurry to move on to the next scene. This is where an editor would generally slice the scene in half, but I was personally enjoying it all. It’s a throwback to older movies where they would stay on a scene far longer. These days, movies just jump as fast as possible to keep everything rolling. I would say that this is the most realistic Batman movie yet. The Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher films were obviously pure fantasy. The Christopher Nolan films were much more grounded in reality with the plots being the most fantastic elements. In The Batman, even the plot of political corruption is entirely believable. I am very happy to say that there is no origin story in this film since everyone knows Batman’s origin. In this film, Batman has been operating for a couple of years. There is nothing related to Batman putting together his costume or testing his equipment, he’s already well established in Gotham City and feared by criminals. This also appears to be his first experience with a super criminal. If the movie falls short, I’d say it’s in the plot. The Riddler is murdering people, sending riddles to The Batman with each murder. Although The Batman is excellent at solving the riddles (he is more of a detective in this movie than previous ones), it doesn’t really help him to prevent future murders or even to capture The Riddler. It feels more like The Batman is just an observer to The Riddler’s crimes. Even when The Batman uses his deductive skills to discover The Riddler’s master plan, it’s all for naught as The Batman is almost entirely an observer while The Riddler’s plan plays out. He does leap into action, but The Riddler’s plan works almost flawlessly. I would also add that The Riddler’s entire motivation gets rather muddled by the end of the movie. It’s almost as if the writer started to panic that The Riddler might come off as the hero of the story, so they needed a quick reverse course. I’d say that the strength of the movie is in the casting, acting and dialogue. This is a very well-crafted movie. The problems are in a rather forgettable and somewhat illogical plot. I also kind of wished the Riddler’s costume bore at least some resemblance to his comic costume. The Penguin also bears only the slightest resemblance to his comic book self. There are some great moments in the film, but I found the climax underwhelming. Finally, I’d say that this film perhaps borrows a few too many elements from previous films. I could have sworn Pattinson had said this would be his only Batman film, but I guess they have given the green light to a sequel with all the cast signed, including Pattinson. I’m absolutely on board with revisiting this world. The end of the film definitely sets up a sequel. I cannot see how this new Batman franchise could possibly integrate with DC Extended Universe and I hope they don’t even try. I can’t even imagine this being a younger version of the Ben Affleck Batman. The closest film I can see to this one is the 2019 Joker, and I don’t see a reason to try and join the two. I particularly enjoyed Michael Keaton and Christian Bale as Batman and I’m not sure where I would rank Pattinson, even in relation to Affleck, but I did enjoy his performance immensely. I’d say that Nolan’s trilogy is still the gold standard but The Batman is a nice start and I look forward to seeing where it goes.",,Great Start to a New Franchise,6,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGDGOUPRBFPFZT3UIMAJZGOXFYKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3STW8K0JJVQRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,KarToon12,,,,,,5.0,"April 14, 2022",United States,"At this point in time, superhero movies have flooded Hollywood, most notably with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, leaving DC's live action filmography having to play major catch up. While they've been starting to make a few strides in branching out to featuring other characters in their history, it would seem that Batman is the number one crime fighter they constantly fall back on. And while I'm a huge fan of the character, even I was initially on the fence of seeing yet ANOTHER film with him when this newest installment was announced. But after good word of mouth, I made the trek to theaters to see this next incarnation of the Dark Knight.....and was completely blown away. Taking place during just the second year of Batman's crime fighting career, the Dark Knight vigilante has made a name for himself in Gotham City; primarily using fear to subdue and deter criminals. While he has the full support and friendship of Commissioner Gordon, the rest of the GCPD are more than leery around him---even more so when Gordon gets Batman directly involved in helping him solve the murder of a mayoral candidate. It doesn't take them long to figure out that a serial killer calling himself 'The Riddler' is behind the brutal crime, with the insane murderer leaving behind a trail of deranged puzzles for our heroes to solve, hinting at who his next victims will be. But the farther Batman goes down the rabbit hole, the more he begins to uncover an entire network of corrupt businessmen, politicians, and policemen; all of whom are manipulating various aspects of the city for their own gain. With the help of Gordon, as well as a former sex worker-turned cat burglar named Selina Kyle, Batman will have to utilize all his gadgets and wits to thwart the Riddler and see just how far the conspiracy goes. And in the process, he just may find out that what Gotham really needs is not an avatar for vengeance, but a symbol for hope and justice. I felt bad for Robert Pattinson back when he was announced to play our main hero, since it seems many people just can't get over his sparkly vampire days of ""Twilight"". I'm hoping this movie will finally put those naysayers to rest, because he's a phenomenal actor who completely disappears into the role of the Dark Knight. He says a lot with very little. He actually doesn't talk a whole lot, and expresses most of his inner emotions and thoughts with his actions and, most notably, his eyes. The movie does an excellent job of showing how and why Batman is considered the world's greatest detective. There's plenty of scenes of him just quietly and meticulously looking over evidence and other tiny details in a room. And while he's usually one step ahead of everyone, the movie's careful to also not depict him as some ridiculous super genius who's perfect at everything. Quite the opposite. There's plenty of times where he screws up or interprets a clue wrong, and half of the fun of the film is trying to solve the case along with the characters. The film has faith in the audience that they'll be smart enough to pick up on these details and not have to be spoon fed information. This is clearly early in Batman's career as a crime fighter. (The movie even points out we're only in Year Two.) Gordon trusts him, but he's still at odds with the rest of the police force. The Batmobile is basically just a beefed up car; fairly indestructible, but nothing too elaborate. He has a few gadgets, but nothing like the seemingly endless supply of swiss army knives he pulls from his Tardis-deep utility belt in past incarnations. He's a competent fighter, but it's nothing stagey or flashy. His punches are calculating and quick--meant to take down a target swiftly the way a real fight would actually play out. Basically, without losing his comic book-y essence, this is, arguably, the most realistic take on Batman you'll ever see. Special mention also goes to the cinematography, in particular, how lighting and shadows were used. The way scenes were shot really put you in the shoes of the people who get snuck up on by Batman. I was constantly scanning dark spots in a room, wondering if and when Batman was going to appear, and nine times out of ten, I'd guess wrong. And much like the criminals, you don't fully see him until it's too late. This is easily the best depiction of Batman's ninja skills that I've ever seen. (Weirdly enough, this movie manages to out-ninja ""Batman Begins"", which had actual ninjas in it.) I don't think I'm giving anything away in saying that the Riddler is the main villain (the trailer pretty much gives it away). However, the mystery doesn't stem from trying to figure out who he is (any comic fan can tell you that). The mystery and suspense comes from trying to deduce what his main goal is, why he's doing what he's doing, and who the next victims are going to be. He's incredibly scary (and is obviously heavily based off the Zodiac Killer). Even scarier is that when his grand scheme is finally fully revealed, you almost find yourself agreeing with him, though of course, he and Batman's methods of trying to take down city-wide corruption are light years apart. I don't want to spoil much else, but there ARE multiple villains in this; probably the most ever in a single Batman film, and yet, it doesn't feel cluttered at all. Every single character, hero and villain, has a purpose for being here, and every single one of them are interesting and/or entertaining to watch. At no point did I ever get bored when the plot veered off to a new person. It constantly leaves you guessing which people are on the take and how deep does the corruption go? On the subject of characters, this is easily the best on screen depiction of Catwoman ever. Her backstory is incredibly interesting, and it makes complete sense why she also goes down a vigilante path and how she has the skills that she does. She's not just shoehorned into the plot so Bruce can have a love interest. She and Batman are practically equals and pretty much partners by the end. On a related note, it's really nice to see Batman and Commissioner Gordon working so well together. In most other depictions, he's regulated to turning on the Bat-Signal, giving some information here and there, but otherwise letting Batman do all the heavy work. Here, he's basically practically Batman's Robin, with the two constantly exchanging and comparing notes and helping one another; sometimes outright saving each other. Finally, this movie decided to take the ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" route and begin the story with Batman already firmly established, with only a few backstory details scattered here and there. The rest, you can easily figure out on your own via the dialogue and actions. This film isn't the origin of how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, but rather, him figuring out how to become a BETTER Batman. He begins the story believing that taking vengeance and striking fear into criminals will clean up the city streets. But when crime and violence only seems to rise, he realizes that, while scaring bad guys helps a little, it's not doing much to give the rest of the citizenry any hope. And by story's end, he may come to discover what he has to do to become the type of superhero that Gotham really needs. This was one of the most refreshing takes on Batman that I've seen in years. It's basically a crime drama with capes, and stays grounded in relative realism without losing the things we love about the character. I can't wait to see what other stories can be told in this new film universe.",,One of the best live action adaptations of Batman ever put to screen,245,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE4BUSB37F7BUAAQBI5JYZ3FM3XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R766M917464HN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1
B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,THowerton,,,,,,4.0,"August 23, 2022",United States,"Director Matt Reeves has brought his take to the world’s greatest detective (apologies to Sherlock Holmes). Reeve’s Batman is hardly Bruce Wayne at all but a thoroughly human man-child introvert irrevocably scarred by the death of his parents. The Batman is, first and foremost, a vigilante fighting to brutalize Gotham’s criminal element but in a close second he is a master detective and it is this egg that Reeves sits on, broods over, and hatches over most of the film. That the Batman is brilliant with an unwavering eye to detail is deftly shown; also that he is young and fallible and so a bit more vulnerable than many of the other cinematic Bat portrayals. The end of the film which turns into a mildly raucous superhero actioner ends up feeling out of place, almost tacked on, but narratively works as a devious pay-off and a too real for the real world telling of horrors that may yet still play out. In fact the intensity of this film, especially in how the characters are studied from angles including the heinous Riddler, comes across as horrifying and not for the younger set as it is simply too…real. This is yet another superhero film that, because of Batman’s history, will be trotted out before children and impressionable youngsters but it should be rated R due to its subject matter. It’s a good movie but it’s closer to “Seven” than “Justice League” in tone, feel, and story. It’s a good movie whereas, say the should have been R rated “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” in all its meanness and crudity had bad acting, “The Batman” has some great acting almost entirely across the board. The police, the politicians, the villains (especially Colin Farrell’s turn as crime boss Penguin), and the anti-hero (Catwoman/ Selina Kyle played by a sharp Zoe Kravitz), even when they’re not given a lot to do they do it well or exceedingly well. Robert Pattinson does a decent job as he broods and broods for days. He’s an odd choice to play Bruce Wayne/ Batman and he does a good job but he’s still an odd choice and doesn’t really fit the part. Still, that doesn’t hurt the film (the ending of the film hurts the film where Batman has an epiphany and realizes that he needs to be a hero and “steps into the light” which is at odds with the entire tone of the film). There is a promise, or a tease at least in the trailers, and that is that the Cat and the Bat will have a bit of a sizzling relationship and unfortunately there couldn’t be less chemistry between Pattinson and Kravitz as a square peg has with a round hole. That’s another failing of the film, but Kravitz’s Catwoman is compelling and she overshadows everyone else in just about every scene she’s in. Maybe we’ll get another movie out of this one: The Catwoman!

If you like comics = watch If you like noir/detective stories = watch If you like grittiness = watch If you don't like any of the above or expect a superhero light show, popping colors or a fast paced epic = avoid at all costs. Although the film was supposed to be able to appeal to a broad audience, it becomes very clear within the first 20 minutes that this movie was intended more for the fans than anything else.

There's something about his presence on screen that is just visceral. There are several shots of just his eyes and the way he's looking at people that is breathtaking to me for some reason. I can't look away. They did so well with his makeup and cowl and it looks so intense. The fight scenes are great as well. No shaky cam, weightless combat.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Amazon Customer,,,,,,5.0,"April 30, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"I've watched Batman media for a long time, ever since the first cartoons. I appreciated the cartoons, so when movies started coming out, I watched them, thinking that I'd get the same Batman I was used to: dry, oddly aimed humor, but focused on sympathetic justice when allowed. Unfortunately, movies put out a ""dark, gritty batman"" that I just didn't like. They didn't feel right. Now THIS Batman? I love. There was no way a man could be a caped crusader at night and still somehow be a lady-killing, smooth talking billionaire in the daytime. Bruce could only ever be an exhausted, socially stunted creature who comes crawling out from the depths of his batcave to wear sunglasses in his living room amidst the remnants of his emo personality. He WOULD have a bass and several large speakers tucked around gothic architecture, he WOULDN'T know how to talk to a woman, he WOULD gloomily tell the man that raised him that he isn't his father. Now sure, this movie is long. Too long. They definitely could have trimmed the fat around some of the scenes, especially the opening scene. However, I've rewatched this movie several times over and I find something new each time. It's enjoyable! I appreciate all the characters and the parts they play. Its refreshing to actually like Batman when I usually root for the villain in these kinds of movies. The Riddler is actually disconcerting, like a true villain. It was nice to see a villain, a real villain that Batman had to struggle against. Robert Pattison is excellent in this role. I wasn't a fan before, but now I can't see the role being played by anyone else. He's intimidating as Batman and delightfully creepy as Bruce. And to those who complained about Bruce not being extremely buffed out...why would he be? He's a brawler, a fast and lethal fighter. He's got to be lean for that.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,M. Oleson,TOP 1000 REVIEWER | VINE VOICE,Verified Purchase,,,,5.0,"June 29, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"Possible spoilers. I had to ask myself, do I need another Batman movie? Especially after director Christopher Nolan’s magnificent “Dark Knight” trilogy. As it turns out, yes is the answer based on this latest iteration from director and co-writer (with Peter Craig), Matt Reeves. Reeves, you may recall was the guy behind the excellent last 2 “Planet of the Apes” reboots. Hell, I remember him from the “Felicity” TV series. This Batman is as far away from “Felicity” as you can get. If you thought Nolan’s films were dark, wait until you see this one. Every scene is at night and it’s raining all the time in Gotham City (A good reason to get the 4K version). Robert Pattinson is a perfect choice for the latest caped crusader, his second year in the job as I recall. Crime is rampant as usual, and The Batman/Bruce Wayne is in a deep funk because he doesn’t seem to be making much headway fighting it. He helps us understand his mental state in a voice-over narration which seems to solidify Reeves desire to make this a modern-day noir. A genre I love. A surge of serial killings by someone who calls himself The Riddler (Paul Dano) gets everyone’s attention including detective, James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), a Batman confidant. Why? Those being targeted are high ranking politicos in Gotham, including the mayor (Rupert Penry-Jones) running for re-election. The Riddler leaves little greeting cards for The Batman that includes clues as to why and who the next target might be. The Batman is very good at deciphering riddles. In addition to Gordon, a few other comic book regulars are here. The Penguin/Oz is played by an unrecognizable Colin Farrell. He is still just a middle manager in the crime world headed by Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Catwoman/Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz) is the best thing in the movie, providing just the right mix of wink-wink humor, badassery and sexiness. For once The Bat’s sensory perception finds romantic possibilities however restrained. Pattinson and Kravitz are great together in their scenes. I was hoping for more. Maybe later. After a couple killings, you can see that the disturbed Riddler feels that he and Batman are both looking for justice in Gotham. After all, when the Batman is asked who he is, he says “Vengeance.” The Batman confesses to Alfred (Andy Serkis), the Wayne family’s long-time butler/sergeant at arms that he no longer cares whether he lives or dies. In a scene early in the film, Nirvana’s song “Something in the Way” provides a perfect tone for The Batman’s sense of helplessness after watching a young boy finding that his father has been murdered. The song is reprised at the end of the film when he rescues the boy from floodwaters. The soundtrack is based on Michael Giacchino’s score. In addition to Nirvana the soundtrack features a Beethoven piano concerto and “Ave Maria” by Schubert to go along with some club music from Baauer, Corvad and Patrick Topping & Kevin Saunderson. The music stands out like a prominent character in the film. There are plenty of scenes of the Batman facing off against terrible odds including an end of the film wowzer. His Batmobile is a nitro-charged V-8 that doesn’t look like something off the shelf. Bruce Wayne’s personal car is a mint 1963 Corvette Stingray, black of course, that he drives to a funeral. If this all sounds incredibly cool, it is. It all adds to the allure, Reeves sees in the film’s setting and characters. So, what keeps this from being a perfect film and the equal of those from Nolan? I already mentioned that I wanted more of The Bat and The Cat. The film is way too long at about 3 hours. I would have cut some of the The Riddler’s rants. There are also at least 2 false endings. Quibbles aside this is a great Batman film and certainly one of the best films of the year. Highly recommended.",,4 1/2 stars. The new Batman is one of the best films of the year.,2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGIXTIMXPEXIUXG7Q663I7GMLOTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VP6YGG2V8FGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

I also have enjoyed the many different versions we continue to see but this one The Batman is by far the most uneven I have seen ever. I was not sure it was the mayor being killed in the beginning of the film nor who The Batman is fighting and why and who he is with. The actor playing Batman is very good but I wish someone would think ahead to write and produce a decent bat film. Like one of the Spiderman movies the hype did not do the film justice. I even turned the 4K blu ray off to watch an episode of Andromeda on blu ray that looks impressive. I also am so glad I did not go to see The Batman in the theatre. Some time I will finish the movie and maybe have a better view of it but for now its not likely. I do have to say though The costume looks great as does the dark feel but it would have helped to have a better script.,,Costume is Okay,5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEZHOE5JNTZ7XMM7Z43XD5HIFLXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROI1ZMMT765OT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

Hopefully they will continue along these lines. Only complaint the movie is very dark at points so much so it is hard to see the action. I know the filmmaker wants to keep things dark to add for the suspense drama and scariness. But it doesn't help the picture when you can't see what's going on.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Niteowl Crypto,,Verified Purchase,,,,5.0,"June 29, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"This is a more dark and foreboding take on Batman. It explores the mental, emotional, and physical tolls that being the Batman takes on Bruce Wayne, more so than in the previous trilogy by Nolan. It laid bear the depravity and corruption of Gotham City which in turn require the Batman. It also showed how inequality can motivate different people to escalating levels of violence based on their own skewed viewpoints, not unlike what we see in many societies today. Robert Pattinson was good as Batman, not perfect but I do hope he has a chance to reprise this role! It's hard to compete with Michael Keaton but yeah... Overall I think he understood the toll of being Batman and the internal struggle he has in wanting to save the city and reform Gotham to the point it doesn't need Batman and actually having to do what he does as Batman. From my viewpoint Pattinson was able to translate that to the screen. It also explored the sadistic nature of The Riddler, it bordered on the level of sinisterism, mania, and psychosis found in real life serial killers. Paul Dano fit the roll of the Riddler very well. The interactions with the other Arkham prisoner (that we can only assume is the Joker) was a nice little wrinkle. I felt that Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman was a superb pick although her actual catwoman costume was lacking. I get that there are limitations due to the current issues facing the world right now but come on costume dept. No offense to her as an actress but she looked like Dumb Donald from the Fat Albert cartoons from the 70's. Shame on you costume dept. shame! The exploration of her backstory fit with her motivations. Colin Ferrell as the Penguin/Oz could have been fleshed out a bit more but this could just be a prelude for a second movie. I have been a fan of Jeffery Wright for a long time, going back to before his work with M. Night. His portrayal of Jim Gordan was monumental in that is showed the difficult waters he has to navigate between using the Batman as and ally and ""consultant"" and the hostilities of the GCPD viewing Batman as a menace and vigilante. I am on the fence about Andy Serkis as Alfred. I felt there was a lot left on the table for this movie and the Alfred character. Peter Sarsgaard's depiction of Gil Colson was lacking. This may just be a set up for introducing Harvey Dent? John Turturro was good as Carmine Falcone. I know there is only so much you can put into a movie so his character development for this movie was adequate and played into the motivations of both Batman and Catwoman. Overall this is a much different take on Batman than the crap of the Clooney and Kilmer batman and darker in nature then the Christopher Nolan Trilogy.",,A Darker Take on Batman,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEGF6LGENM4OVLSU6WXKEU5VXL5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRP43WQS6JNY1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

So dark and captivating... it draws you in from beginning to end and you cannot turn it off! I've had it on repeat all day long (with English subtitles) and will watch it again TONIGHT!!! Looking forward to the sequel. Man, I'm thrilled that since The Dark Knight trilogy, Batman hasn't failed us. Such an interesting spin on events. The cast... well-seasoned actors and actresses coming together to make this happen for enthusiasts... they absolutely pulled this one off in grand fashion! I have nothing negative to say about The Batman... Keep em' coming, DC!! Oh, and this was the first movie I've ever redeemed on my streaming service account! Everything worked perfectly! Well, it's on their, at least. I've not tried watching it yet because I've still got the Blu-Ray DVD in the player! Hope this helps! I'm not a super comic geek that can go all the way back to knowing the first date of Batman's appearance on Detective Comics, but Batman happens to be my favorite character... DC or otherwise. I was not disappointed at all, and I've sat on watching this DVD for quite some time, but I'm thrilled I finally watched it today. I'm sure you will be as well.

This movie was dark, subdued, goth-like really, and all those things are not necessarily bad for a Batman movie, and I understand that Batman is very dark and troubled, but everything was really lacking nuance, and it was all very predictable in a sense. The movie was so aware that it was dark it seemed to lessen the impact of it, and made it interesting simply for the shock value of the depressing and violent situations. It also made the movie a bit boring and cringy at times to sit through. The Joker was way overly dark much like everything else in the movie. Leave some of it to the imagination I guess my point is.

But as for the speaking in monotone and hushed tones by nearly everyone except the screaming victims?! Lol! It's like Batman on downers or emo Batman. Bob Kane would definitely not approve. But I understand that most young audiences dwell in the dark, with designer drugs, underground clubs etc so it is marketable as a movie. But Batman is far from ever just being a young, brooding, monotone idiot wearing a party mask & clodding around in heavy boots making the most amateur of detective, physical, mental, tactical mistakes. He didn't just take a few self defense classes one day and then go out in a suit of high tech armor to stop crime wherever he could find it on a daily basis....he left those duties to the police. The real Batman operates on another, higher level. As for the romance in the movie? Again a marketable move to appeal to the younger audiences and keep in step with the politically correct ""girl power"" movie times we live in which is fine but again Batman is above and beyond-not equal too anyone he works with or faces. When Batman finds that he is that is when his mind (normal/abnormal) kicks in like a hammer warning him that if anything goes sideways and this person betrays him or cannot overcome their flawed human emotions....he's got something for that!",,"A dark, low budget piece of garbage",10,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFDDKL4JQGV6AAJEXJ4XBQI2QWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2N4ZYVBZYWYVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

Pattison's portrayal is a total snoozefest and what is with every Batman now having this low/breathy voice ala Christian Bale? Pattison is largely just copying Bale. Someone mentioned his acting is 'wooden', that's on target. Is it so hard to give Batman some kind of personality? Maybe go into why he's so deeply flawed? He's sleep walking through this. He looks good in the mask, his contributions end there IMO. Sorry, I really liked Bale, and Keaton also added something and gave both Bruce Wayne AND Batman some kind of quirkiness and genuine depth and uniqueness that is sorely missing in every other Batman I've watched. Zoe as Catwoman, probably the best acting I've seen from her, but she is another boring/flat, one-dimensional actor. If you've seen her in one movie, you've seen her in everything. Five foot 2 and 99 lbs soaking wet it's hard to imagine her tossing people around and being any sort of threat. I get so tired of 'fun size' actresses attempting to play these lethal ninjas, it's laughable (e.g., Batwoman - Ruby Rose, please okay?). Colin Farrell as Penguin is really good and pretty much stole the movie (which wasn't hard considering the main actors). Heath Ledger is still the absolute best villain EVER/no contest. The CROW was apparently a major influence on the writer(s) and whomever designed the sets. Lots of Crow vibe and some dialogue and certain scenes are strikingly similar. I recommend you rent that if you haven't seen it if you want to see a REALLY excellent flick based on a comic with great writing and brilliant acting and memorable characters, rent Brandon Lee's, THE CROW, . I could go on, but I don't want to bore you more than the movie will. Wait for this to come out on prime if you're super curious, I wouldn't even pay $1.99 to rent this thing.

I also don't care at all how dark the movie was. That has nothing to do with why I was let down. I am shocked how little acknowledgement there seems to be about just how much Matt Reeves took from Christopher Nolan. And I use the word took very generously. Batman beating up thugs in a night club, Batman knocking bad guys off a building to have them dangle, Catwoman's theme sounds a lot like Catwoman's theme in Dark Knight Rises. Even the last shot of the film is Batman on his motorcycle driving off. The Batmobile scene was great until you realize how many people died at the hands of Batman trying to chase someone for questioning. The opening of the film was superb until it got to the actual Batman reveal which was just boring and uninspired. Fight scenes also lacked any real thrill. Riddler was over the top and just a wasted opportunity. I liked Catwoman okay and Penguin was the stand out performance. As many have said way too long, way too much whispering and lingering scenes.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Michael W DeSilva,,Verified Purchase,,,,5.0,"August 17, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"Okay, first let me start by saying that I have never seen the Twilight series, nor have I seen this actor in anything else. Second, let me inform you that Batman was never my favorite hero. I thought he was okay, but I preferred Superman and even Spider-Man over Batman, so none of that has anything to do with my review here. Now, having said that, I have still seen all the Batman movies with all the different actors. None of them were ""great"" movies in my opinion. They were just okay. If I had to choose, I would have said Ben Affleck's Batman is my favorite and in my opinion, Batman vs. Superman and Justice League had the best Batman. That was before I saw this movie. This movie, however, is really, really good. This takes place early in Batman's career, 2 years into it, and it is almost a prototype Batman. His suit is more realistic looking, his gadgets are more primitive and he doesn't have an endless supply of different gadgets yet. Even his Batmobile is very basic and more ""mobile"" than ""bat"". Commissioner Gordon is not yet the Commissioner of Gotham City. Bruce Wayne himself is still young and is just learning who he is and who The Batman is going to become. And he is one BAD dude! This Batman is angry and doesn't like criminals a whole lot. When he fights, it is deliberate and he fights to take someone down as quickly as possible. There's no playing around. This batman takes no bs from ANYONE, including the police! This movie really captures The Batman's early years and shows him struggling to change from Vengeance to Justice! In all honesty, If ALL the other Batman movies and even the comics had shown these early years of a struggling Batman, he would have been much higher on my favorite superhero list. Even the make-up and wardrobe for the bad guys is by far the most realistic and best I have ever seen. The Cat-Woman has a very primitive costume. The Penguin FINALLY looks like a man AND does still somewhat resemble a penguin somehow. It's amazing. The mob boss is a likable and believable character. The Riddler confused me a little bit at first because to me he looked like Bane, another Batman adversary. But his wardrobe grew on me and I can accept this costume as the Riddler. I don't really have a choice anyway. The crimes and gangs are much more realistic and as a whole, ""Sorry Ben Affleck"" this is now my favorite Batman movie and favorite Batman to date. I highly recommend buying it. Don't let the gossip about Twilight boy interfere with you watching a good movie. Accept it as the young Batman just starting out and you should love this movie as well. Especially if you are a true Batman fan, which I am not. And as an update: I've had the dvd for about a week now and I've already watched it 5 times. This Batman is just so cool and especially in the beginning when he moves all slow and deliberate, using fear just as much as fighting skills to defeat his enemies! Just buy it already.",,Excellent movie!,5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AERK67ATDMPP6M3O6YVGRJIEEOAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3T3QYN51JNQRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Shaq,,,,,,1.0,"May 15, 2022",United States,"I waited for this movie to get good for 2 hours and 56 minutes. The story line was so boring. The entire thing. The casting is terrible. The guy from black panther as Alfred? Really? Andy dermis played an amazing villain in black panther but in this was boring, unconvincing and simply didn’t fit the role. Robert Pattinson as Batman? Really? He was not believable and didn’t convince me of the role. Couldn’t sell me on it. Even though he “beefed up” for the part he looked scrawny and should be more in a movie like the notebook or a soap opera, he may Be a good robin but in no way batman. then turtturo as falcone? Really? Great actor otherwise but not in this role. Cast in the completely wrong role and was not convincing. Then the riddler you couldn’t find someone other then a young bill gates? The scene where Batman was flying in the air with the suit on, the camera trick was last used in the 1950s. Couldn’t make it look more believable? Instead let’s strap on a selfie stick and cut off the top part of his head and make it look like he’s flying. Unbelievable hype for such a wack movie. I feel like most people are just so blinded by the hype they dont notice the boredom, the unbelievably poor casting, the lack of excitement, the prolonged scenes to draw out the movie and make It as if there is some sort of suspense. All three of the last Batman series with Christian bale had me enthralled and on the edge of my seat. This one was not even close. I would watch it to see what the hype is about but don’t expect to be entertained. I can’t reiterate how boring it is.

I watched the behind the scenes and realized it was the director and screen writer that have no clue to what batman is or why people are pulled toward the character. Such a disappointment. Basically the director wanted batman be a street fight with perception. He was raised by MI5 who would have taught him have to be a observant as anti terrorism among a slew of other skills that doesn't just have fighting. He is a detective character and has well of connections to capable of being a simple street fight. I hope that if they do another batman that they get rid of the screen writer and especially director who has no clue about definition of character or story. Throwing things in the story but if you look at the story it really was boring and it just jumps for one moment to another without really a connection.

To those who are fans of Batman, read the comics, etc you'll hate it. They've randomly decided to use the Riddler's birth name Edward Nashton for whatever reason instead of the easily recognizable Edward Nygma (E. Nigma). They also chose to make him into some school shooter vibe idiot, instead of the evil genius the character is supposed to be. This Batman is pathetic, moody, lacking in the typical Batman genius, and generally acts like a pubescent basement dweller. This Catwoman is a flaming racist blaming white people for anything wrong. The typical Batman gadgets are non-existent, and the Batmobile is the wrong kind of ridiculous belonging in Fast and the Furious not Batman. This movie followed the typical woke movie nonsense playing to the racist stereotype that white people are the problem and the Catwoman knockoff even plays the white people bad card.

On the positive side of things, they eschewed silly CGI and green screen fx as much as possible and tried to make a real story out of it. However, it was excessively long and, while it had some good moments, simply dragged on and on and on in its own confoluted narration. I had to intentionally try not to fall asleep.

Speaking of toxicity it was also trying too hard to be woke with the comments like 'white a** privilege', and I'm not white, I'm a calico cat mix, but I'm not a fan of those ridiculous stereotypes. The story was just the same tired theme of trying to save Gotham City. Robert Pattinson was okay as Batman and can deliver his lines, but his performance was bland. Christian Bale still tops the ferocious strength and intensity of Batman. Zoe Kravitz is beautiful and a good actress, but was also underwhelming as Catwoman. Almost didn't feel like it was Catwoman. Michelle Pfeiffer still tops the ferocious strength and intensity of Catwoman. Actually that's a combo I'd love to see in a Batman film, Christian Bale's Batman with Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. Colin Farrell is unrecognizable as the Penguin, but that character was underused. The Riddler was okay, but at times felt like the actor was just reciting the lines.

This was supposed to be a 20's detective noire film. And it was. The problem is Bogart would fit better in this movie than Batman. - Riddler gets away with everything. Batman does not stop his plans. He just arrests him after the fact. Batman was always 5 steps behind - The whole movie is Batman just accusing everyone he comes across as being riddler. Is it you Catwoman?! Are you the Riddler?! I see in the video he released that he's a white male who wears glasses, Come clean! You're riddler aren't you?! - Penguin has to school him on Spanish grammar after Alfred already pointed it out to him. - Bruce Wayne just berates Alfred every scene he's in. - Does Zoe Kravitz have vertigo? She's CGI for some basic kicks. I don't know if she can walk a straight line if they're animating her for the stuff they animated her for. Blade 2 levels of rubber body CGI. When she hops down a ladder she's flex armstrong. She was a mile away and out of focus, a stunt woman couldn't climb down a ladder? Next scene she's fighting batman throwing kicks at him. She's a rubber band man again. I think Batman might be CGI here too but he looks much better. It basically looks like a scene from roger rabbit with a toon fighting a human. There were some good things: - Catwoman was pretty good - Riddler was excellent - Penguin was great - This was the best Batman/Gordon relationship we've seen on film. Best Gordon on film yet. - Most batman movies are 80% Bruce Wayne with Batman showing up in 20% of the film. This was the opposite and that is a good thing. - Batman's tech was plausibly high tech. With Batman it's either ""He uses customized advanced military weaponry"" or ""He has a bat copter and bat shark repellent and a bat space ship and bat lasers"" and it's just too far out in sci fi world. This was a nice balance. - I liked seeing a younger batman still figuring stuff out. He makes some mistakes. Probably too many actually. I don't think Pattinson was necessarily bad. I think he just wasn't given much to do.",,Spoilers,11,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHE6DXPVTTS2PURHT2QCJUCPM6IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNVGZNFJBX8LD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Kat,,,,,,1.0,"April 27, 2022",United States,"OMG - What a pile of ----. If you want a really off the wall version, then this is for you. And spoilers if you haven't seen it - so the trolls keep off my back. I grew up with the more campy version of Batman with Adam West and Bruce Ward, and I loved the campy movies with Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito. I even liked the Christian Bale movies - minus the last one and what they did to Catwoman was WRONG. Halle Berry's Catwoman was far superior to Anne Hathaway, no fault of the actress - you can only do so much with a badly done/written script/character. What they did here - there are no words for. Sorry to say, but Patterson cannot pull off the role. Bruce Wayne is a playboy, and unfortunately for Patterson, they make him look like some emaciated stringy pale wanna be gothic lank haired basement dwelling lowlife - and that's being kind. They turn Alfred into the Brains of the operation - which he was to an extent, but Wayne has a genius IQ. And please tell me how you get super cool contacts that video record and transmit live images and still get around Gotham on a dirt bike??? And that Batmobile was a crying shame. A stripped down old time muscle car ( Nova, Charger, Mustang, etc) with what looks like a swamp boat fan sized/shaped engine on the back of it. I get this is the ""Early Batman"", but keep things consistent with the technology being used. As for the stunts and such - Only Superman can throw off bullets (plural) at point blank range and keep going. I don't care what layer of armor you're wearing - it would take a normal human at least several minutes to get up from a single point blank range shot to the chest. Granted we are talking Batman here, but come on, let's get real. Speaking of real - the director and choreographer could not for the life of him/her stage a fight. Patterson's director and choreographer need to go back to school. He/she makes him look like a 3 year old flailing in the air to throw a punch. Even Keaton, Klimer and Clooney appear to deliver better looking shots in suits they could barely move in, Bale by far being the best. Catwoman was a travesty. The character herself is not an evil murdering criminal, but far from a 'oh let me help you out here', sing koombaya together shades of light gray bad guy they come up with here. Oh and her being the ""love child"" of the king mobster and lets not forget the kissing with Batman with zero plot build up or sexual tension. Or the bad ski mask cut out with nobby 'ears' and the bike chain she flails around. I was waiting for the bad goggles from the video game. In ranking of potrayals - Julie Newmar, Michelle Preiffer, Halle Berry - who also had superior directors and character development to work with. The Riddler - I think they wanted to use the Joker because the Riddler was never a cold blooded thought out murderer. You get in his way, sure, bang your dead. But he was a thief, a nutter with delusions of grandeur. This guy is certainly insane, but the whole 'I'm doing this for the exposure of corruption and perceived injustice to myself and others' isn't his schtick. It's not even the Joker's. Murder in some sick ways, sure, but to expose corruption? Only if the plot is ultimately disguise a super massive bank robbery or something. And let's NOT talk about the Joker's line at the end ""Riddle me this."" I'm sure someone will give the 'oh it's alluding to X Y Z', whatever, it fell flat. The ONLY thing the movie did moderately well was the visual look of the Penguin. The facial prosthetics used you could see a Penguin visage there. Most of the time his character wasn't too bad, but then he went stupid silly that didn't fit the character. I so want my money and time back. I won't be watching it if this combination of talent is put together again for another Batman movie. I'm sure this is some weird twist of a comic/graphic novel version of Batman - but yick. Make an animated movie out of it and call it done.",,"Save your money, save your time.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Sean,,,,,,5.0,"April 22, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"The Batman is an honorary tribute to DC's (Detective Comics) roots, reminding us that the Batman is the world's greatest detective, not a superhero. What makes The Batman so unique? Unlike The Dark Night trilogy, The Batman is not a plotless, flashy, battle-filled action movie. The Batman is set in a comic-accurate universe, its dark, gritty, and seeping with corruption waiting to be unveiled. And it is that corruption that gives birth to the Riddler. For those who missed the plot, here's a summary. (SPOILERS) The Wayne family created a Renewal fund for the orphans of Gotham. To the Riddler, who had been an orphan, the Renewal fund had been a beacon of hope. But then he discovered that the Underworld had been leeching off of it and not a single dollar had ever gone to any orphans. This enraged him, and he swore that he would purge Gotham of Underworld scum. Already, the Riddler has a complex backstory and an intriguing moral compass. He is an anti-hero. A product of Gotham. When he discovers that the last living Wayne is the Batman, a fellow anti-hero who had been cleaning the filthy streets of Gotham, he grows obsessed, enamored, delusional.

In the end this sense of changing to trust and taking positive action is subtly brought out. Growing up with the revised version of Batman starting around 1970(?!) where Batman was ""darker"" and more realistic, compared to the sixties and before, I really liked this grungier world where people appeared to have costumes that could actually be made by people rather than by a factory in China. I don't keep up with current comics, so can't say how it matches anything there, but I was entertained, I liked the main characters tremendously, thought the action was realistic and not overblown, like the mind-numbing CGI robot action in Marvel movies (though I like other things about them).

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Sudo Nym,,,,,,4.0,"April 28, 2022",United States,"In general, I feel like The Batman is a solid if not earth-shattering take on a character who's been through countless reinventions. Pros: -Pattison is perfectly serviceable as a young, ""year two"" Batman. This Bruce Wayne is still finding his footing and though he's a skilled crimefighter, he's still rough around the edges. Pattison does a good job of bringing those insecurities into the picture. - The detective story aspects of the film are a refreshing change from the solves-most-problems-with-fists Batman stories that we usually see. I honestly would like to have seen even more of the riddles, cyphers, etc. being worked into the narrative. - We actually see Bruce/Bats experience some personal growth from the beginning to the end of the film which is always a bonus in superhero films. - Jeffrey Wright is GREAT as Jim Gordon. He pulls off the optimistic yet world-weary vibe with ease and makes the character more personable than even Oldman did (which is saying a lot). Cons - Kravitz does a good job with what she's given, but the Catwoman character falls flat. It feels like the writers tried to shoehorn too much backstory in. With all the baggage she carried, she could have been split into two characters and even then it might have been too much telling and not enough showing. - Serkis is wasted as a ho-hum Alfred. If Catwoman was overloaded with backstory, Alfred has the opposite problem. It's hard to feel that there's any real connection (or reason for connection) between him and Bruce except in one or two minor spots. I would have much preferred the kind of paternal, occasionally skeptical dynamic shown in the Nolan trilogy. - I get that it's one of the darker Batman films tonally, but from a visual / lighting point of view, it's TOO damn dark. Don't get me wrong, I love the lurking-in-the-shadows stuff... but in this case, you mostly just get the shadows. I honestly thought there was something wrong with the projector for the first hour. - We seem to have replaced Bale's Bat-rasp with an entire cast who whisper 85% of their lines.

It reminds me of older movies where someone would hire a Private Detective. The few action scenes were good, don't get me wrong, but at times I lost interest. This is just a personal preference, I like films that move fast throughout, and this one just seemed to have times where I'd find myself looking down at my phone shopping for stuff on Amazon.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Hank,,,,,,4.0,"May 12, 2022",United States,"my review is really a 3 star but because it is Batman and he is my favorite super hero, I gave it a 4 stars. The movie is a noir style and it has a lot of good things and more bad things about it. The good thing is the relationship of Batman and Gordon and I love the fact that Gordon has a lot of appearances and he is with Batman almost all the time (he may as well be called Robin) and also the fact that you see more of the Batman rather than Bruce Wayne because the actor sucks as Wayne. He is a punk, which Bruce Wayne never was, and the director tries to make him contemporary to attract the youth but that makes the character very weak. He is about to cry all the time as Wayne and even as Batman in some scenes (I kind of liked the sensitive side of the Batman but for the love of God, he is the vengeance). The CatWoman is really awful and I don't mean the actress (or maybe it is her) but the relationship between them has very tender moments with good soundtrack to accompany them. The costumes were dirty and home made (I think that was intentional) and they cinematography is kind of blurry as it that camera has the filter at all times or the lens was smudged with a fingerprint or something. The 4K UHD is not visible and the HDR does not make any indication that it exists. Overall it lacks what Christopher Nolan did with the Dark Knight, which was to make him contemporary and new and made him believable and real. This is a Batman movie filmed in the Blade Runner world, rain is constant and the skies are dark and gloomy. I sensed that Riddler was a bigger character and I think that Colin Farrell as The Penguin really stole the show here and he was the most memorable person in this whole movie. The Joker was hideous and I am glad they cut him off in the movie because it had enough ugliness in it. And why is it that every movie these days has to have a racial slur in it? Everyone in Hollywood is entitled to give their opinion about people but that does not include themselves. They are all good people in Hollywood. Why don't they shut their mouth and just entertain people, because they are not good for anything else.",,Good Batman but a terrible Bruce Wayne,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGS6VJI5B2OMPFA7JV2C37NDMABQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CR3IXLPCS28D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Shelldbow,,,,,,5.0,"May 28, 2022",United States,"I’ve been a Batman comic and movie fan since the first Tim burton movies and I think that this movie is great in its own way. This MAY have spoilers. Never has Batman been portrayed like this before, actually doing detective work with Gordon, forging what would be a strong bond. Also, Batman is young nd has plenty of room to grow and gain experience but at the Same time he’s done enough that he’s extremely brutal and tough on the criminals and knows how to handle himself pretty well. Robert Pattinson plays a very broken, depressed Bruce Wayne who doesn’t get out much, would much rather leave on his mask, and is extremely wreckless but in a tough way. Alfred is played well by Andy semis, who tries his best to bring out Bruce’s humanity and light. Selina Kyle/Catwoman is done wonderfully here by Zoe Kravitz; she has a wonderful backstory, her character development is great, and she really plays the role well. As far as the Riddler goes, there are good and bad elements; the good is that he is given a more dark approach. the riddles and traps are intense, Edward by Paul Dano is actually more interesting to watch I think, and there’s so much psychotic energy there. However, Paul Dani reminds me of bane with his mask whereas the riddler is much classier in the comics or at least wears a green suit with the hat and cane instead of a black bag and a question mark. Sometimes he also kind of reminded me of bane from the dark knight rises which was disappointing but not horrible or anything. As for the Penguin and Carmine Falcone, they nailed it with John turturro and Colin Farrell in prosthetic. I didn’t care for the batmobile design but it’s still a cool car and has great scenes. A lot of people complain about the length of this movie and to some extent i understand but there was a lot of ground to cover and they barely got it in 3 hours. Sometimes scenes did move kind of slow but upon repeated viewing I noticed more and more. The one issue I have with this movie is the lighting; sometimes it’s hard to see Batman or certain events because of lighting but it’s rare and a minor complaint. Pattinson is a better Batman than Bale in my opinion ( that’s saying a lot), but doesn’t beat out Keaton. I look forward to him growing in future movies as Batman. The story was extremely well written and the Nirvana song was well placed but as good as the score was, there wasn’t enough of it in key scenes. I still give this 5 stars. I recommend multiple viewings to fully get it and appreciate it. And no. It’s not “liberal propaganda “ as some reviewers suggested, it’s just a different tone like the crow. All Batman fans should see this, highly recommended and enjoyed; not for kids though for sure.",,Pattinson getting warmed up in an excellent portrayal and movie,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFJGXSR6PHGMLT7PFR2I4YQLLOMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13QHXXNB39ZP3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Wayne Klein,HALL OF FAME | VINE VOICE,Verified Purchase,,,,4.0,"July 05, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"A surprisingly strong “Batman” flick that adds to the genre rather than detracts like many other films, this is worthy enough to belong to the Nolan films. As a reboot, the film may revisit familiar characters but does so in some innovative and interesting new ways. ‘The Batman” focuses on a Gotham again in peril wit the vigilante caped crusader doing thr detective work that was often missing from the more action driven flicks in the various films. Robert Pattinson does a very good job although his Bruce Wayne is a bit more mopey than some previous incarnations. A villain nicknamed The Riddler is causing havoc on Gotham as The Batman tackles corruption in the city of Gotham. Curiously, The Riddler’s victims dovetail with many of the people that Batman is investigating himself. He also has to content with and eventually enlists Selina Kyle. Kyle works for the Falcone organization but has her own motives for wanting to destroy the criminal. Featuring a virtually in recognizable Colin Farrell as the Penguin and Paul Dano as a very different (in the movies) Riddler, this was clearly influenced by Batman: Year One. Matt Reeves who co-wrote the script and directed the film clearly had a creative vision (and it didn’t hurt with Warner thar Reeves had also directed two of the popular “Apes” reboots as well as “Cloverfield” where he demonstrated an ability with genre films with a large scale production). The film did well enough to do a second film and it was critically acclaimed. The film runs too long and could have easily been trimmed by 30 minutes without harming the production. That flaw aside, the film demonstrates that Reeves has the goods to carry on with an interesting variation on the character that is equal to Burton’s and Nolan’s. The Blu-Ray and 4K versions of the film both look and sound exceptional. The only disappointment is that there isn’t a commentary track but the nine featurettes and the nearly hour long making of film does provide plenty of background and trivia on the making of the film. Reeves reboot of Batman does the job admirably. Although the film runs too long, it does have some terrific set pieces and performances from the marvelous supporting cast including Andy Serkis as Alfred and Jeffrey Wright as Gordon.",,Reeves reboot is a lot of fun but runs too long by 30 minutes.,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQ3SYSQU74LZ3Q763TUBQNHNDGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KBDRLD3GLFVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Jorge A. Zarco,,,,,,5.0,"August 05, 2022",United States,"The Batman(2022) is a good Batman movie. It's directed and co-written by Matt Reeves(the director of Cloverfield). Robert Pattinson was cast as Bruce Wayne/The Batman. A serial killer known as The Riddler is leaving dead bodies across Gotham City. Batman and James Gordon follow the trail of dead bodies. The Riddler is preying on the wealthy and trying to expose ""skeletons in their closet"". Alfred Pennyworth is injured by a letterbomb and Bruce discovers secrets about the late Thomas Wayne. The film starts with Batman beating up criminals. The audience is already familiar with Bruce Wayne's tragic backstory. The dramatic, melancholy music score by Michael Giacchino is really good. Zoe Kravitz was cast as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Colin Farrell in ""fat guy make up"" was cast as The Penguin. He had a lot of teenybopper fangirls at one time. The fight scenes were well staged. I cheered as Batman beat up street punks and Riddler clones. The Batmobile chase on the freeway was cool! How was it crafted? You can hear Nirvana's Something in the Way and Ave Maria on the soundtrack. This film is three hours, but it's not boring. Batman was created by Bob Kane with input from Bill Finger. Finger co-wrote the cheeseball 1976 movie Track of the Moon Beast.

This Batman is an Marxist, Feminist, Emo alternative universe Batman both of which are not sustainable. This Gotham is such an evil and dark place that who would really care about saving it and this Batman is too junvenile and silly to do so even the ridiculously ineffective, neutrered Batmobile and his silly, non Batman motorcycle would never hold up in a real battle.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Matthew D'Souza,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,,,,,5.0,"May 25, 2022",United States,"Robert Pattinson is the most brooding emo Bruce Wayne and brutal Batman yet! Director Matt Reeves’ superhero, neo-noir, murder mystery, epic The Batman (2022) is certainly one of the greatest films of the year already. The Batman does have intense thrills like Batman beating down gangs of Penguin and Riddler’s henchmen or the Batmobile versus Penguin car chase. But, Reeves has crafted a genuinely depressing, moody murder mystery that finally allows Batman to be the world’s greatest detective on the silver screen. I appreciate Matt Reeves and Peter Craig’s haunting writing. Their vicious Riddler killings are chilling and well orchestrated. You actually wonder what each riddle means in the midst of this crime epic. I cared about all the nuances of political intrigue, illegal dealings, murder clues, and seedy underbelly of Reeves’ Gotham. I love how menacing Gotham feels with anyone coming out of the dark to attack Batman. The Batman feels closer to Zodiac, Se7en, Cure, Blade Runner, The Boston Strangler, or Memories of Murder than other superhero movies out now besides Joker. Reeves directs The Batman to be gritty and dark as he uses shadows as doorways for Batman’s entrance or Wayne manor as Bruce Wayne’s pristine lair of solitude. The Batman is easily the finest film that Matt Reeves has directed to date! Robert Pattinson is enthralling as cinema’s most brooding and emo Bruce Wayne. I loved his haunted expressions, subtle looks, gaunt appearance, and fearsome gravitas in every scene. Pattinson pulls off the forlorn, nihilistic Bruce Wayne narrating and chronicling his nightly ventures as Batman. You feel his despair and fury with each curious gaze at a witness or clue to his brave facing of Batman’s endless foes. Pattinson has gone from romantic teen heartthrob to indie darling to embodying Bruce Wayne’s dark contemplations. He is a phenomenal actor. Robert Pattinson is right up there with Christian Bale and Michael Keaton as my favorite Bruce Wayne. Zoë Kravitz is sultry and sympathetic as Selina Kyle. Her fierce Catwoman feels effortless as she uses her sheer sex appeal to flirt and sneak about as The Cat. I really loved how she made Selina’s character her own with her clear trauma and isolation. You believe Kravitz’ Selina Kyle could love Pattinson’s dejected Batman. Michelle Pfeiffer’s Catwoman remains my favorite incarnation of Selina Kyle’s iconic anti-hero to Batman and love interest for Bruce Wayne. However, Zoë Kravitz feels intimately cautious and fearlessly independent as Catwoman. She is a wonderful actress. Paul Dano’s villain The Riddler is actually scary and intriguing. Dano is ruthless when killing Riddler’s victims and delightful to watch enact his conspiracy enlightening plot upon an unsuspecting Gotham. He is absolutely deranged and delivers a high caliber villain performance for The Batman. Jeffrey Wright is a really cool and intelligent Lieutenant James Gordon. I love how he’s helping solve clues alongside Pattinson’s Batman. John Turturro is a sleazy and underhanded Carmine Falcone. Peter Sarsgaard is great as the creepy and worthless District Attorney Gil Colson. Andy Serkis is great as the supportive and helpful butler Alfred Pennyworth. He feels steadfast and sharp as Alfred right up there with the other classic Alfreds in film. Barry Keoghan’s cameo as The Joker has me curious about where Matt Reeves will go for his sequel. I was hoping Joaquin Phoenix’ Joker would appear opposite Robert Pattinson’s Batman, but maybe that’s just my indie drama fan at heart speaking. Keoghan was brilliant in American Animals and Chernobyl, so I have no doubts about his dramatic acting skills. Editors William Hoy and Tyler Nelson keep you engrossed with striking cuts by Matt Reeves’ stylish direction as The Batman does not feel slow for a behemoth run-time of 176 minutes. Cinematographer Greig Fraser’s stunning shots and careful framing is breathtaking. Many shots made my jaw drop like Batman appearing from the shadows or fog several times to Penguin’s Iceberg Club rave fight. The Batman focuses on Bruce Wayne’s reflective journey of self purpose by day to Batman’s inspiring heroics in the night. Seeing Fraser’s visceral close-ups during conversations is as entertaining and thoughtful as his mesmerizing wide shots during the meticulously choreographed action sequences. I truly was dazzled by the ruthless nature of Pattinson’s brutal hand to hand combat as Batman. Matt Reeves outdid himself really. James Chinlund’s production design makes all these grisly murder scenes and dirty street sets for The Batman. Gotham really looks grim with no hope in sight until the caped crusader’s cowl fades into view. From the constant rainfall like in Se7en to the ever present shadows like old film noir classics, The Batman looks incredible. Art direction from Grant Armstrong, James Lewis, Joe Howard, Gary Jopling, Candice White, Anita Rajkumar, Oliver Benson, Agis Pyrlis, Will Houghton-Connell, Luke Whitelock, and Matthew Kerly looks outstanding. From Penguin’s chaotic club to the watery finale cascaded into dark lights. Matt Reeves’ The Batman is perhaps visually the most creative and dread-inducing of all the pictures starring Gotham’s dark knight. Set decorators David Chow, Laura Ng, Patrick Dunn-Baker, Chris Sanford, Manuel Vilaseca Vaya, Chris Cortner, and James Flanagan’s adorn Wayne manor with precious antiques, while Riddler’s home is overflowing with files and murderous preparations. Every home looked lived in honestly. Visual effects artists Mark Owen Forker, Alex Bicknell, Karen Kelly, Russell Earl, Ben Pickering, Dan Lemmon, Brad Minnich, Loren Robinson, Anders Langlands, Cody Stoof, Simon Butler, Bryan Searing, Julius Lechner, Andrew Kalicki, and Daniel Hazeltine bring The Batman to life. From Batman soaring in Gotham’s dreary night sky to Batman’s Batmobile roaring to life with searing blue flames. The Batman just looks astounding with very realistic CGI. Composer Michael Giacchino’s thunderous score is one that will remain in the minds of every viewer long after seeing The Batman. His bombastic main theme with its groaning melody and frightening eerie atmosphere are genius. I love how the score changes suddenly or fades into existence. The use of Nirvana’s throbbing melancholic song “Something in the Way” is touching and haunting all its own as well. Sound designers Chris Terhune, Andy Nelson, Lee Gilmore, Will Files, Douglas Murray, and Phil Barrie ensure every punch from Batman feels like bricks hitting men to the Batmobile’s screaming engine sounds like it is wailing to life. Costume designers Jacqueline Durran, Dan Blacklock, Rupert Steggle, Lorna Cook, Lizzie Moul, and Steve Wotherspoon create a heavily armored Batsuit for Robert Pattinson as well as sleek gentleman’s suits. Batman’s Batman actually looks protective and cumbersome to move in with a serious presence on screen. I loved all Catwoman’s slick catsuit and fancy dresses and clubwear. Make-up artists Naomi Donne, Doone Forsyth, Samantha Denyer, and Kat Ali craft and paint Colin Farrell into the fat and unsightly Penguin. Their ultra emo aesthetic for Robert Pattinson’s Bruce Wayne is fitting. Their Catwoman make-up is very cute. Overall, The Batman must be seen in theaters to appreciate the powerful score and Matt Reeves’ killer murder mystery. The Batman fulfills Reeves’ promise to make a real neo-noir detective mystery.",,The Brooding Detective Noir I've Always Wanted Batman to Be on Film,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHJ4DXWU5OFMXPABFMQGJGCQKI4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S25MJ8PBFEE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,J-Stack,,,,,,2.0,"May 15, 2022",United States,"What a mess! I know it’s early on in the Caped Crusaders career, but the story is ALL OVER the place. He has the crappiest suite ever (somehow it’s bulletproof, bombproof and shotgun proof too), but some of the best gadgets ever. His car is crap, but his motorcycle is awesome. Bruce looks like he was concocted from the mind of a Prozac, Ritalin, Adderall induced Goth mind who feels that look and demeanor are the norm of dealing with life and the hurdles it throws at you. That’s not to say btw, that greatness doesn’t exist in all of us, it does. You just have to believe that. Since I came up in a time when those “medicines” didn’t really exist, I wasn’t sedated and had to deal with life “head on” and my belief grew, so maybe that’s why I get it, but don’t relate to our strung out looking Bruce. However, that last bit falls in line with the gratuitous doses of “White Privilege” and typical other (re)programming minutiae of the current Hollywood narrative, what you end up with is a long, drawn out mess, with no clear direction and an ending that seemed to rush its overall point with some generic verbiage of supposed insight, as if “getting along”, “accepting each other” and “tolerance” has just been thought of by this generation and no one before. LoL. Overall, the movie was just blatant Hollywood propaganda and the people who can appreciate it now as relevant, won’t understand this review until the next “Great Reset” when they become truly “woke” and are left scratching their heads.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,D.D.,,,,,,4.0,"June 06, 2022",United States,"I DID NOT intend to like this portrayal of BATMAN! I have been a fan of the B-Man from the old series (I was like 7 so laugh it up!) to this newest adaptation. It is said to notice the “woke-ism”, and I did. But the look of Gotham City is perfectly dark, even down to the opening on a rainy street with Bruce wandering around (no spoilers right now), then the story is narrated greatly by the Batman’s voice, which added the old 1940’s detective movies era to the film (which was present also in Blade Runner - the original cut, and later removed which was a mistake, as B.Runner was a great sci-fi detective post-apoc hybrid movie by my ALL TIME FAVORITE WRITER: THE ONE AND ONLY PHILIP K. DICK). But in the Batman 2022, I see the youth draw-in, and myself being a published author of 1 book and 9 short stories (under 50 pages each), and a contract for a screenplay which is driving me CRAZY WITH WRITING TO UNHOLY-WOOD’S set tempo, I have and do judge books and movies HARSHLY! You might know my pen-name, as “fame is to sell a name,” as in the title, THE Batman, I liked the movie. DC has lagged behind Marvel in hit movies by an exponentially large acre and infinite miles. So, the movie we are discussing, The Batman, is NOT going to level the bar, but it’s a really good adaptation of Batman and has all the necessary elements of story, action, mystery, characterizations which often are off color, and who knew “Edward” would go from a Vampire in Twilight to the Batman?!?!

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,Neil Ford,,,,,,4.0,"April 22, 2022",United States,"Matt Reeves's film ""The Batman"" is an amazing achievement, but unfortunately falls short in some small but crucial areas. The film is especially important for being the truest portrayal of the essence of the Batman's character and world on film. What do I mean by that? I should start by clarifying that if you mostly know Batman from the movies, or think that Batman only really started with the Frank Miller books of the late 1980s, then you have an incomplete view of the character. From those late 80s books we got the image of Batman as a fantastical monster, gothic and grotesque. And from the movies we have gotten a sort of Baby's First Batman, a summary of the character that necessarily abbreviated and stereotyped in order to produce a popular mainstream film. Setting aside the zany, silly Batman of the mid-40s to mid-60s (about which a whole separate essay could be written), I think the periods which are crucial for grounding the character are the first few years of the character's origin in the early 40s, and the now almost-forgotten Batman comics of the 70s. This 70s period had a gritty street-level approach which reflected the low point at which New York (model for Gotham City and home of DC comics) found itself at the time, and the new trend for messy naturalism which had arisen in American cinema. For a while, Batman even lived in a penthouse apartment and drove a glorified muscle car, as in this movie. In this kind of setting, you get a psychological realism that you don't get in more fanciful versions. And that is something we get in ""The Batman"" which I don't think we've seen in movies before. For all that Nolan's films are photographed very naturalistically, they are not very realistic in psychological terms. Nolan's Batman is a mythic warrior, Jim Gordon and Alfred are both saints, and the villains seem to be dedicated to evil purely as a matter of principle. Powerful, archetypal stuff, maybe, but not relatable. ""The Batman"", by contrast, has a very stylised colour pallet, but its characters are more grounded than we've seen before. Previously, Bruce's psychological trauma was something to occasionally reference, but here all that had been hinted at is made explicit: it's easy to say that Batman is driven by trauma, but here we see that trauma etched into the character's face, embodied in the huddled, defensive way he holds himself, and the way he talks as though he is unused to verbal communication and human relationships. It's a revelation to see this state of mind revealed rather than paid lip service to. Suddenly the existence of the character could almost make sense in the real world. And Jim Gordon is no longer impossibly good, noble and wise, somehow on a god-like level compared to the cops with whom he serves. This Gordon is hardened, streetwise, tightly wound, and fully familiar with the organisational politics of the police. I'd also like to mention Falcone, who is not in the movie a lot, but who eventually is revealed as a crucial player in the story. The more we learn about his involvement in the story, the more layers of his character come to light. The complexity of his character is perhaps the greatest mystery which Batman solves in the course of the film. All the performances in the film are excellent. I was even impressed with Zoe Kravitz after being disappointed by her in the High Fidelity TV series. Colin Farrell as the Penguin works in the role, though he plays a surprisingly small part in the film, and I do still wonder why we got a young-ish actor in (very convincing) old-age make-up, when there are plenty of good older actors who could do the part without prosthetics. The actors playing the cops and crooked politicians were all very effective in their parts. The Batman costume caused some controversy after being revealed in the trailers, but as used in the movie it doesn't raise an eyebrow. It is effective and right for the world of this film. I enjoyed the technical enhancements this new suit contained, and was only disappointed that they weren't more used later in the film. The Batman's car is a powerful presence in the movie, being frighteningly aggressive and unpredictable in a way which matches the personality of its owner. As presented in the film, it really does have a persona in a way that makes previous Batmobiles look merely like fancy cars. Script, photography, editing. It's hard to separate these elements out, as they always seem to be working together in perfect unison. The amount of cinematic craft put into this film is impressive by how concentrated it is in execution and how total it is in effect. Every scene, and almost every shot, seems to say something powerful about how we relate to each other, about power, exploitation, vulnerability and isolation. Further, the script explores elements of the Batman story which seem so obvious and powerful in hindsight that one wonders why they weren't addressed on screen before. I'm talking about the question which any person who wields any sort of power must ultimately answer to themselves: is it better to provoke fear or inspire hope? The script goes beyond a simple ""naive niceness versus Machiavellian realpolitik"" dichotomy, to look at the way strong personal examples inevitably influence others, whether for good or for bad, in ways that can't always be predicted. The music has provoked comment from all who've seen the film, and I will be no exception. The ""Batman"" musical motif (it is too simple to be called a theme) becomes incredibly powerful just by careful repetition during the course of the film. The way it is used really is a stroke of genius. However, rest of the soundtrack is less innovative, but still effective. Sound design is good - but home viewers are warned that they will need to boost the bass to understand the impact that the cinematic experience had. Watching on a laptop computer probably won't cut it. Thus far I have mostly lavished praise on this film, but there are a couple of issues which I think have a negative effect. The first issue is that there are some moments of inadvertent silliness which undermine the drama. One example is the odd woollen mask that the Cat wears. I am aware that it was in one of the comics, but in real life it just looks daft. Another moment takes place after the car chase that is the climax of the first half of the film. The way Batman peers down to look at Penguin just looks comical, though it's obviously meant to be impressive. The second issue, which has been much commented on, is the length and pacing of the film. Setting aside the issue of bladder control, when we talk about a film's length being a problem, what we are really talking about is a matter of structure and tone. There are parts of the movie where the use of deliberate pacing is brilliant - but in other areas a quicker pace is needed, if only for the sake of contrast with those slower parts. A structure without contrast can create a monotonous tone, which can leave the audience feeling exhausted and beyond that even bored. I think that may be why people's attention begins to wander during the film's climax. There might also be the issue of the director himself becoming exhausted, as the climactic fight is not as visually interesting as action scenes earlier in the film. It could also be argued that the sequence ends with a series of ""wow"" moments which are each impressive in themselves, but they are piled up so many upon each other that the effect becomes bathetic. A few well-spaced climactic moments will inevitably be more effective than an apparently endless series of climaxes one after the other. The next criticism I will make is that the romance seemed unnecessary and unconvincing. I thought we were past the era of movies forcing romance into films where it's not needed, but apparently I was wrong. This element might still have worked if the actors had 'chemistry', but sadly they have none. They try but the result is not believable. Instead the romance contributes to the film's pacing issues, adding nothing to the story while taking up valuable screen time. It is especially a problem for the film's ending. It really should have ended with the shot of Batman looking up at the helicopter, this moment signifying the conclusion of his story arc. Instead, this powerful moment is undermined by a Riddler scene that teases a sequel, followed by a scene of the Bat and the Cat saying farewell, which is both structurally unnecessary and, thanks to the lack of chemistry, boring. So the movie really ends with a thud. If these scenes were going to be kept in the movie, they really should have been a post-credits bonus, not part of the main film. In terms of audience reaction, the response has been surprisingly divided, but reading the one-star reviews gives the impression that some people are not able to understand the film. It seems they just can't cope with the emphasis on mood and character, and a hero who isn't a wise-cracking he-man. To put all the above criticisms in context, I'd like to set this film beside the recent films of Denis Villeneuve. Villeneuve has received a lot of praise for his films of Blade Runner 2049 and Dune, but I think he has been overrated. He is certainly a very strong visual director with an acute sense of detail. However, I find his films cold and hollow, concerned with style for the sake of it, and with not much meaning beneath the surface. There are also some rather silly story and character elements which he covers up by means of immense grandiosity of execution. Reeves doesn't have quite the extreme control of detail that Villeneuve has. On the other hand, he has something to say. As I said above, every part of ""The Batman"" is suffused with meaning - and not the abstract, mythical meaning of fantasy, but meaning essentially concerned with what people are like, and how we relate to each other. And where Reeves has fallen short, at least he did so while taking a big swing. In what might be the peak of his career, he has created something unique: he has created the truest Batman movie that has ever been seen. I suspect this achievement will last for some time to come, and we should be thankful for it.",,The Spirit of the Batman,30,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFUFO24HAZ5JB7HZL5F7WSIVERUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PYEPSBO1NHMB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

We can only play it on one DVD player in the house which is the family room. If your DVD player is old you can’t watch it. Every time we play it no sound comes out and only subtitles. Every time we watch it we have to change the language to English to give us sound and it apparently takes subtitles away. As we thought we fixed it we were wrong. You have to turn on a language every time you play it. As it isn’t frustrating for people who have the latest DVD players/Blu-ray, on old ones we can’t change because we don’t have remotes to older DVD players. We can only watch it in the family room instead of one of our bedrooms. The solution is to either get a brand new player or throw the disc away, buy a new one, and hope it works!!",,Why was ours made this way??,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEUJIYOYICKI4NVHELBNWAXOFWXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YEZTP26QZCZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1

The only justification for its length is that it probably enhanced the dark, gloomy atmosphere in which the plot depended. The main villain is The Riddler, played superbly by Paul Dano (although his real face was revealed only towards the end, but what a character. Pattison as Batman? The jury will be split for sure - just as whether Brad Pitt made a good Achilles. The Riddler, in this movie, set out to kill important people including the DA and the police commisioner, while also targetting Bruce Wayne, whose father appears (according to the Riddler) was connected to the assasinated people. Zoe Kravitz and Colin Farrell were excellent support as Catwoman and the Penguin respectively. Farrell is almost unrecognisable, but is probably the next best actor after Paul Dano in this film.

B09XC5SKR2,The Batman,4.5,558,alex,,Verified Purchase,,,,5.0,"August 13, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,"Batman is my favorite superhero and I am glad they adapted him right. The Batman is a serious noir detective film. They did not turn it in to a comedy, like what another studio would have done and ruin the tone from the source material. The movie has a good long length of time to tell a good story and develop the characters. Also two great bonus scenes that I wish were in the movie. The movie has everything you could want in a Batman story, like new gadgets, a Batman suit which looks like it is based off on the Arkham knight. The Arkham knight is my favorite Batman game so that’s extra points for me. They are parts of the movie that reference Batman comic books that I also liked, Batman fans will know which ones. The action scenes, the acting, the music, the cinematography were all great. Batman has a sweet new bat mobile as well. I bought the LEGO version just so I could put it together, it was fun every step of the way. I am glad the riddler got a chance to shine as the main villain instead of the joker again. Dino did a great job with that role. I always knew he would because I saw him act in the movie their will be blood. The only thing bad to say and I am just nitpicking is I wish the action scenes were a little bitter longer because they are so good. I think this movie is on the same level as the dark knight, but The dark knight is still the best Batman movie, I don’t know if it could ever be topped. The bottom line is this is an amazing movie, that every Batman fan should have.",,The Batman is a fresh new start for the franchise.,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE2U7TVJZT4LTD4TT37IDX4T5QFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09XC5SKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Robert Pattinson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLT0JSBBJ7QLV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XC5SKR2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B09XC5SKR2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+batman&qid=1664324014&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI1IiwicXNhIjoiNC42NyIsInFzcCI6IjIuODAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=the+batman%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1
