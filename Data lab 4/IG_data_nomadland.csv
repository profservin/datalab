"B095322ZW8","Nomadland (4K UHD)","4.3","866","Susan Matson","","Verified Purchase","","","","5.0","July 12, 2022","United States","Most of us know, or think we know, what it‚Äôs like to be homeless or on the brink of losing a home. On the flip side, it‚Äôs a sweet dream to imagine living out of a small trailer for a short vacation down at the lake. But this fictionalized bit completely believable story melds those two visions by shining a light on those vagabonds permanently living on wheels, with no fixed address. Along the way, opens up whole worlds: of people with pride and identity but forced to be continually on the move when the monthly or semi yearly rental agreement ends: always on the edge, looking for something better, without any real prospects on the horizon. This is a feast or famine existence, where a lucky few get short-term employment at best and seemingly live without plans, from hand to mouth. At worst there is the prospect of disease and old age hitting with no support systems built into a trailer park or roadside stop. At best, there are impromptu communities and warm sharing of resources‚Äîbut these are fragile networks, like feathers in the wind. The vagabonds move on and on, sometimes meeting again randomly‚Äîor not at all. This was a highly original work in the style of a documentary built on a simple empathetic character trying to build a life on shaky ground..the small world of a camper, clothes in one corner and portapotty in another. There‚Äôs little energy left for looking back about mistakes made. There‚Äôs only the decision about how to do the laundry, and where to find groceries this week. With a turn of bad luck, almost any of us could be in her shoes. This chance to have our eyes opened to the possibility is the gift that this movie offers.","","Eye-Opening!","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGP4NMMAM3VBS7B5BXJRXXDTHRBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=83&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R379J6D59JCVPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

"B095322ZW8","Nomadland (4K UHD)","4.3","866","John P. Jones III","TOP 500 REVIEWER | VINE VOICE","Verified Purchase","","","","4.0","July 31, 2021","United States","This movie is based on the eponymous book by Jessica Bruder, which was published in 2017, with the subtitle ‚ÄúSurviving America in the 21st Century.‚Äù I read and reviewed the book on Amazon in June 2019. It provided an insight into one of the subcultures of American life: people who choose, or more often are forced by economic necessity, to move from place to place within our borders. Within the last couple of months, I watched and reviewed Werner Herzog‚Äôs tribute to Bruce Chatwin, entitled ‚ÄúNomad ‚Äì In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin.‚Äù A core theme of the movie was about Chatwin‚Äôs fascination with people who move from place to place. Thus, when I saw that Chloe Zhao had directed a movie based on Bruder‚Äôs book, and particularly because it stars Frances McDormand, whose acting ability I have admired since seeing her play the sheriff in ‚ÄúFargo,‚Äù I knew this was a must-see film, despite Amazon‚Äôs heaviest price tag for a movie: 6 bucks. McDormand plays Fern, who had led a reasonably comfortable life in the company town that US Gypsum had constructed at Empire, which is in northwestern Nevada (its current population in 65). Fern‚Äôs husband died after a long illness and US Gypsum shut its plant for making sheetrock, after 88 years of operation, in 2011. Fern is suddenly without a home and has to hit the road, with limited resources and only her van to live in, thereby entering the nomadic subculture. The movie provides the visual images that the book could not, highlighted by McDormand‚Äôs stoic face as she deals with adversity, or even ‚Äúa good day.‚Äù Fern and other nomads work at Amazon warehouses, temporarily, fulfilling the need for seasonal labor during the winter holiday season. Another big employer are the various campgrounds that need on-site hosts, during the summer season. There is also flipping hamburgers at Wall Drugs (of the many, many billboards) in South Dakota, and the beet harvest in Nebraska. All a slice of economic and social life in the fly-over zone. Zhao cinematography created some great images. Quartzsite Arizona is just off I-10, near the California line. The modern-day Bedouin gather there in the winter, after release from Amazon‚Äôs seasonal demands. They sit around the campfire, with a ‚Äúguru‚Äù of sorts, who helps them adjust to their new nomadic lives with positive advice. He has coined an aphorism: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say goodbye, just say I‚Äôll see you down the road.‚Äù The movie incorporates numerous real-life nomads, using their real names. But I had a few more problems with the movie than even the book. Sitting around the campfire, briefly identifying themselves, going around the circle, Zhao decides to include one of the hoariest of clich√©s: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Vietnam Veteran and I suffer from PTSD.‚Äù Yes, there is an extremely slender portion of the population that fit that description, but for unknown reasons Zhao excludes how the vast majority of people arrived at that campfire, as described by Bruder: ‚Äú‚Ä¶due to the economic circumstance of the Americans, many of whom had ‚Äòplayed by all the rules.‚Äô Many were on the road because they had ‚Äòdrunk the Kool-Aid‚Äô of always rising housing prices, and in 2008-09, watched the government bail out the bankers, who had caused the problem, but not the homeowners. Many others were there due to medical bills they could not pay and the subsequent bankruptcy. Others due to downsizing and ageism. Divorces, of course. More than half the American nomads are woman, in the 50‚Äôs and beyond.‚Äù Zhao also decided to completely shear from the movie the violence that nomads must face. In the movie they mention Linda May building her ‚Äúearthship‚Äù in the Arizona desert that will be there for her grandchildren but omits what Bruder said in the book about her neighbor carrying an AR-15 because of all the drug runners. Oh well, I did like the images, even though it seemed to get stuck on sunrises and sunsets, and I do like the music of Ludovico Einaudi. 4-stars.","","Like the Bedouins of old‚Ä¶","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG3FF65U3UCHYSNYNLAI7AGKPGIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SP6ULAXLGU93/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

"B095322ZW8","Nomadland (4K UHD)","4.3","866","H.Tell","","Verified Purchase","","","","5.0","February 15, 2022","United States","I agree with the reviewer who called it a story of resilience. The protagonist is in a very ""non-Hollywood"" age/sex/socioeconomic/ geographic demographic, yet her housing/job predicament is not uncommon, and is in fact a sociohistorical phenomenon that is worth a look, so this is an unusual and *more-than-refreshing choice* (!!) for a character study. People with ADD will find Nomadland boring. They can move on and watch cartoons or Bruce Willis movies or T&A or whatever. They won't find what they're looking for here. It is indeed very quiet and slow-moving, and nothing is spelled out for you. The landscapes are bleak, inspiring, and beautiful. The story tells itself without shoving anything in anyone's face or treating the viewer as stupid. I wouldn't call it a ""liberal movie"". Millions of proud, independent people live on the edge in a highly developed nation, and this is thought-provoking, whatever your political stripe. I looked for other movies similar to it after watching it, because of the quality and unusualness of it, but haven't found a single one yet even similar to it! Would like to see more cinematographic work of this level, and fewer ""grand-scale, plastic, special fx"" type things and Pixar crapola. It doesn't have a pat or fairytale ending, and what impresses is the spirit of these lower-income displaced people and their sense of community, their love of freedom. The movie doesn't look down on these people, or preach at the viewer. They just are what they are. If you like Studs T and show-don't-tell realism, you will like this award-winning oeuvre.","","understated and excellent","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6L6XE37SYP2HKB6GZGMVHRLL5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33BL2AILQKAU3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

I have no critique to offer except that much of the socio-economic aspect of the book was squeezed out. A harsh critique of American economics has been transformed into a hymn to American character. And while both aspects existed in balance in the book the film glosses over the pain and difficulties of the lifestyle. Chapters were given to Camperforce, beet harvesting and campground work and how the difficult physical labor offered to poor old people destroys them. There‚Äôs none of that here. Beautiful film though. Easy for people who wish to remain blind to injustice to watch and appreciate.

There is really no need to go into spoilers, because the movie really isn't about our protagonist, so much as shinning a light on the American Gypsy. From the start, we get a down on her luck woman, who slowly adopts the nomadic lifestyle to a point she cannot envision any other life. We get only tidbits of her story, peppered here and there in the dialogue, leaving us almost entirely in the present, which leaves the viewer with very little reason to sympathize with are main character as she has no visible character arc to make her more or less interesting. On her journey, she meets a colorful cast of other gypsies and is confronted by family and friends whom misunderstand her life style. That's it, roll credits. I won't deny, its a beautifully constructed film that expertly portrays the the spiral that leads to a nomadic lifestyle. What it lacks is substance that would make the movie interesting. There is no climax, there is no steady progression, or even any real character progression. What you get in the first 10 minutes of the movie, is pretty much what you get the whole movie. There is no central theme, or arc. The movie just meanders from event to event with only the flimsiest of connections. Every Act is essentially the same as the last one. As a 3-act film, its boring.

When it was really time to go, she hit the road. As she travels down the road she meets old friends and makes new friends. The human connection is never lost. Friends are made.

It's not bad-- but it's no masterpiece, either. Frankly, I found it to be so condescending that I found myself actually getting a bit annoyed at all the heavy-handed ""portrayal"" of those ""poor people"" who are, by the way, you and me. It's not fair to set up a certain unfortunate population as either the villains or the heroes because they happen to be experiencing something as a group. This reminds me of the all the propaganda films about soldiers-- which usually portray ""our glorious boys"" as special in every way, when they're just ordinary people trying to survive. When you put them up on a pedestal, you no longer have to treat them like human beings, and that's the agenda here. It's too bad. I'm sure some of the folks involved in this movie really thought they were helping-- but when you stop being outraged by homeless camps and see the guy on the corner with a sign as a cute little character -- you've been desensitized again.","","Not the Worst -- Certainly Not the Best","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH4QT7NGIHUJQ2LHRSJGIAXYLRFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UPNT961CH89Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

War is one. Until the onset of mass incarceration and big data, virtually all Americans had been privileged for over a hundred years not to have to experience bondage or enslavement as another. But in 2021 it doesn‚Äôt matter so much whether you want Google, Facebook or Amazon. They all want you. and pretty much aren‚Äôt taking ‚Äúno‚Äù for an answer. One way to seemingly evade the slow creep of digital stalking into our lives might seem the isolation and loneliness omnipresent in Chloe Zhao‚Äôs Nomadland. In one way it presents the answer to those who feel their privacy and sense of self eroded over the past twenty years. In another, such a lifestyle is a very poor substitute indeed, and a price most can‚Äôt afford. For starters, people of a certain age do tend live like McDormand. Not so much in vans or on the road. But in the ways we have been wronged in life, and the ways we have wronged others, forgiveness isn‚Äôt so much a practice but a coping mechanism that enables us to maintain useful relationships, friendships and even contact with less than fortunate family and extended family. Nomadland only briefly touches on and then quickly glosses over themes of death, substance abuse, terminal illness and severe mental illness that cannot always be escaped by sleeping in the back of our minivans for a few weeks or months. In fact, often, those are part of the forces and poorer personal choices that make living harder and worse, for those already experiencing hardship. Nomadland thankfully stays true to these realities of ‚Äústreet living‚Äù even while glossing over much of the grittier subject matter. McDormand provides an amiable enough character who does not ‚Äòdeserve‚Äô to be subjugated to her van-dwelling depression, perhaps any more than the average van-dweller deserves an Oscar just for living in a van. Such are the strange times that we find ourselves in, when those who cannot even afford a subscription service to see their lives played out in the celluloid, find themselves at least represented by talented story-tellers, if not robbed and misappropriated of the real pain, suffering and hardship of their all too real personal experiences.","","on the road again","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHMDBTT5JVHO45D7EHUNIKLQ4XSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NS0OCY33CNUV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

They find community in the wilderness with others who share their wanderlust, forming close bonds and experiencing joy in simple things, especially nature. The work they do is grueling, even demeaning, and exposes a segment of the American economy that seldom gets attention. The scenery--in Nevada, Nebraska, SD, and California--is starkly beautiful.

I stumbled across the book several years ago. It caught my interest. I read it. Shortly afterwards I discovered a movie was made from the book and about to be released. A couple of years later I saw the movie. While the movie is derived from the book, the primary theme of the two are vastly different. The book is about the authors perceived economic injustice in society towards a very small class of people. The movie is about grief. The grief that Fern has about losing her husband, about losing her job and her way of life, and about her personal finance situation where she has to live in her van. The movie shows subtle references to long term decisions and poor choices she has made that has led to her current situation. I give the movie 3 stars, just average, which is better than the book.

"B095322ZW8","Nomadland (4K UHD)","4.3","866","Dingfelder","","","","","","5.0","April 26, 2021","United States üá∫üá∏","This is a wonderful movie, but a quiet one that builds subtly. It also treads ground that is difficult and can be dark. It does wind up with a coherent ending, so doesn't just leave you hanging, but it might not be apparent at first -- or appealing, as the lead character, Fern, makes some out of the ordinary life choices that might make some people feel uncomfortable. In America, at least, we are not much trained to approve of people who make lifestyle choices far different from our own ... unless perhaps they strike it rich in the process. I hope I can help make the movie easier to swallow for those who want to feel their way through it as well as those who don't, or are left unsure. Fern loses her husband and becomes mentally and emotionally paralyzed in the process. Still practical, she does what she can with her limited resources and builds out a van -- that is, equips it in a modest way for living in. No showers or anything glorious like that; she's not a plumber or radiating money. Then she hits the road. There she meets other people who have come to an unusual lifestyle, some by choice, many by necessity. She works at a few season jobs, encounters a possible future mate, learns to live differently, and visits her sister. The latter is a situation I would describe as both caring and a bit overbearing as only family can be. The implication throughout this movie, and throughout our society really, is that everything Fern is doing is wrong and should be changed. That should she feel differently, she is wrong and traveling down a dangerous road that could not lead to either security or happiness and that path is therefore of very little value at best ... but more comparable to being reeled in to one's doom. Everyone else knows what's best for Fern before she's even sure what she herself wants. The movie is not explicit with its value judgments regarding Fern or how she thinks and feels. It merely lets Fern live and discover for herself. There will be no ""right answer"" for you or I or Fern in this movie. The movie is essentially about hard freedoms and obligations and their trade-offs. I think most of us were raised to find Fern's trials and tribulations to be barely contained nightmare. Fern and everyone she has known for most of her life were likely raised to think exactly the same. What the movie is about is not Fern being right or wrong, but becoming truly open to her choices and what they are all about, what it is to be her and and the prices she will pay for that no matter what she does. You will find people saying Fern is wrong in many ways, and so finding the movie irredeemably dark and pointless because, after all, we DO know best. That will even anger some people and make them dismiss it. I'd suggest seeing it, watching it with an open mind, and keeping in mind that other people's choices are not our own and do not have to be. Not even to be good. For them at least. Or maybe not. But the freedom to decide is something to embrace, too. So is the freedom to see possibilities creatively. You can exercise your own freedom to see possibilities creatively by watching the movie with an open and sympathetic eye.","","Love, freedom and their tough decisions","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFWKS5NBJ6WSEB4QF7MUYAPIGWAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KISIBZ0691PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

"B095322ZW8","Nomadland (4K UHD)","4.3","866","Carl Schultz","","","","","","5.0","April 17, 2021","United States üá∫üá∏","‚ÄúNomadland‚Äù Distributed by Searchlight Pictures, 108 Minutes, Rated R, Released February 09, 2021: Fiction and reality are artfully crafted together in ‚ÄúNomadland,‚Äù the new motion picture from filmmaker Chloe Zhao and Searchlight Pictures that‚Äôs generating a lot of talk about Academy Award nominations. As with her previous films, Zhao casts actors and non-actors together in a mostly real situation to produce a timely and often moving hybrid of life and art. Based on--or rather inspired by--journalist Jessica Bruder‚Äôs 2017 nonfiction social studies examination ‚ÄúNomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century,‚Äù in Zhao‚Äôs picture a sixty-something widow loses her job with the 2011 closure of the local US Gypsum plant in Empire, Nevada. The manufacturing complex is a casualty of the Great Recession of 2008, a business failure which effectively eliminates an entire US Zip Code. With few resources and no close family since the recent death of her husband, the newly-unemployed widow sells most of her belongings, buys a secondhand minibus, and takes to the road, traveling through the western United States searching for temporary or seasonal jobs to sustain her. During her odyssey, she discovers an entire population of people like herself--a demographic of modern nomads called ‚Äùcampers,‚Äù displaced by the economy, traveling from state to state in search of work, living nowhere...and everywhere. Filmmaker Chloe Zhao, best known for her 2018 serio-documentary western ‚ÄúThe Rider,‚Äù finds in Bruder‚Äôs 2017 study another carefully-shaded human drama, a dynamic of modern American society with echoes of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression in the 1930s: Strong and independent spirits searching for a place to sustain themselves on the American prairies. In her source book, Jessica Bruder describes the people as ‚Äúa wandering tribe‚Äù investing in ‚Äúwheel estate (and) driving away from the impossible choices which face what used to be called the middle class.‚Äù As with her previous films, Zhao with ‚ÄúNomadland‚Äù is careful to avoid condescending to her subject, or patronizing her characters. While the failing economy might‚Äôve been the catalyst for the odyssey and migration of some of the people in ‚ÄúNomadland,‚Äù for others the road has become a way of life. For those, the sound of the highway has become as comforting as the sound of the ocean surf or the rustling of leaves on a summer evening. With the exception of its two central roles, the rest of Zhao‚Äôs cast is made up of non-actors, actual campers living in the style of the characters they portray onscreen. In the role of the displaced widow, actress Frances McDormand with her weathered and careworn face and weary, intelligent eyes can wring more emotion from silence than other actors can convey with a page of dialogue. Rather than a movie star, McDormand seems like one of us. And in ‚ÄúNomadland‚Äù her character‚Äôs circumstances might‚Äôve changed, but her dignity is intact. Discovered by the child of a former neighbor relaxing in a Walmart lawn chair at Christmastime, she‚Äôs asked whether the rumors are true that she‚Äôs homeless. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù McDormand reassures her young friend, ‚ÄùI‚Äôm houseless--not the same thing.‚Äù In its pervasive sense of an elemental nobility among its characters, ‚ÄúNomadland'' bears favorable comparisons with John Ford‚Äôs classic 1940 film ‚ÄúThe Grapes of Wrath‚Äù...and the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel on which it was based. In fact, the highest accolade for ‚ÄúNomadland‚Äù might be that it helps to define America at the beginning of the 21st century. It‚Äôs a movie John Steinbeck would‚Äôve been proud of. Filming of ‚ÄúNomadland‚Äù took place over four months during the autumn of 2018 with director Zhao and cast members McDormand and David Strathairn living in actual campgrounds on locations along the way in Arizona, Nevada, Nebraska, South Dakota, and California. America‚Äôs magnificent western vistas are beautifully photographed for the picture by cinematographer Joshua James Richards--in many first-run cities, the film is being presented in the IMAX format. Author Jessica Bruder‚Äôs source material was also adapted into a 2017 documentary short subject by filmmaker Brett Story entitled ‚ÄúCamperForce.‚Äù Vastly different in tone than the soulful ‚ÄúNomadland,‚Äù ‚ÄúCamperForce,‚Äù is easily available for viewing on YouTube. ‚ÄúNomadland‚Äù is rated R for nudity, and some adult themes.","","Heartbreaking...and Life-Affirming","9","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEF4TWHTZIEVDGJAN3KWS6EZ2SOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVBANUMRKO7B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

But it glossed over many of the hardships that were in the book. Namely that many seniors are living in vans and cars because of running out of money or losing their homes in retirement. The book, Nomadland, was a documentary about these people and how difficult that life is if you are broke. There is a big difference between going RVing as a vacation rather than it being your only home. In the book, people in their 60s through to their 80s were having to work very physically difficult jobs for people that age. 10 to 12 hour shift jobs at Amazon for holiday temp jobs. Working at beet factories lifting heavy bags of beets for hours. At parks during tourist season.

There are people along the way who loved and supported her and she rejects them. I don't get it. She broke hearts and disrespected the love offered her. I also had a hard time keeping track of the change of scenes and where she was. Sound quality could have been better and the picture not so dark, even in her sister's house, it looks like they're eating in the dark! I'm an elder and have experienced great loss as well, so this review doesn't come shallow. I've been on hospice once. My husband didn't find me worth keeping and wanted a divorce after 28 years of marriage, and painful, chronic illness makes it difficult to enjoy life. I appreciate learning more about the nomad life but I found the main character depressing. Listening to Bob Wells. gives hope. It made me cry every time he spoke. He's a genuine comforter who has chosen love and service despite great loss. Next to him I was very moved by the woman with the terminal illness. I'd be tempted to live a nomad life to experience any degree of camaraderie and community the way it was depicted. Not living a nomadic life and ""having it all"" can also be very isolating and lonely. A sense of belonging is worth more than gold. We need to take better care of each other regardless of whether we live in a car or home. I would probably rename this movie ""Facing the End of the Road"" or ""What Matters Most."" p.s.

The acting, the actresses and actors, the cinematography, the portrayals of certain lifestyles, the realism. What did I not like? Mainly this: The movie deals with loss of loved ones, death, grieving, depression, and memory. I am tempted to say that the movie and its characters wallow in these, but that is a bit harsh. It would be better to say that it focuses on them and dwells on them. It is possible to break through these things. We are not condemned to be stuck in them. There are ways of dealing with negative memories and negative thoughts of all kinds, and being free of them. I suppose, in a sense, that _wallow_ is the correct word. It is unnecessary and unhealthy, and it is a poor way to spend time. The movie could have offered much more. Philosophically or psychologically or spiritually it fails to break through, and fails to offer high value or true resolutions. It could have been much sharper, higher, and more valuable. It deals with some great life issues, but doesn't penetrate them.","","Beautiful Acting and Cinematography, but No Breakthrough","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE45S7AIPFRCZQ7HF4IFAUGKVEBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SWDTHS55CZ81/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

Basic story template: Person faces disappointment after their failed American dream. Having become disillusioned and facing adversity they ""drop out"" and embrace self-pity as a lifestyle choice. They view everything though a foggy, dark gray lens. Briefly they return to reality (in this case to borrow money from relatives) only to use the opportunity to insult those that choose a more mainstream (and actually happier) existence. Then, possibly because they are addicted to self-pity, they return to the gray netherworld of their own making. This is a trope of novels and young ""film-makers"" that gets reproduced every few years. Every new batch of creators and critics seems to think they are the first to take a cynical view of life (especially middle-class life), so we see this gray goop reemerge periodically. Even the cinematography is cliche'. Yes, yes, a really expensive 4K camera, super expensive lenses and hundreds of hours of digital editing will produce amazing, affecting images. Big deal. I can do that with my iPhone. Anyone can lease professional grade camera equipment. The point is that the cinematic metaphors used in this are basic film school stock. In the end this is just a story of a self-righteous person who sees misery and self-pity as a rewarding life path. Another title for this film could be ""Sad Sack"". Here's the ironic part: The main character is shown working at Amazon and there are overtones of the dehumanizing exploitation of such employment. I laughed at the irony of my paying Amazon $3.99 to watch this drivel. Turns out I was the one who was exploited and now disillusioned! Can I have my money back?

Jahrhundert mit einer Mischung aus Entsetzen und Melancholie gelesen. √Ñhnliche Ph√§nomene in der Gro√üen Depression, so wie eine einleitende Beschreibung in einer Margaret Atwood-Dystopie hatten mit den US-Arbeitsnomaden bereits vorher konfrontiert. Anders als der textliche Impulsgeber, erz√§hlt der Film die Geschichte EINER Nomadin - Fern - die unter anderem bei Amazon, in einem Campingplatz in einem Nationalpark und bei der Zuckerr√ºbenernte arbeitet. Und hier w√§re schon eine erste Kritik anzubringen, denn im Vergleich zu Vorlage werden die Arbeitsbedingungen vergleichsweise harmlos dargestellt √úberhaupt wurde auf eine klare Darstellung der reale Zahlen (2020 3.000.000 Arbeitsnomade und Autobewohner in den USA), der systemischen Hintergr√ºnde und der Tribalismus innerhalb der Vandweller-Gemeinde u.a. weitgehend verzichten, so dass diese ohne Kenntnis von Bruders Buch nicht wirklich deutlich werden. Filmerisch ist der Film ein wenig im Bereich des leicht romantisierten Sozialfilm der 70er und fr√ºhen 80er aus Frankreich einordbar - und damit auch √§hnlich melancholisch stimmend, was die oft von Einaudi stammende Filmmusik noch verst√§rkt. Chlo√© Zhao wollte KEINEN politischen Film machen, was bei der gegebenen Thematik ein wenig seltsam erscheint. Denn es gibt soviele Aspekte des Amerikanischen Traums und des Manifest Destiny, die hier auf- und angegriffen, dass ein Film zumindest im Zeigen von Umst√§nden nicht wirklich unpolitisch sein kann.

I can't remember the year EXACTLY, but I was living in Portland ME with two roommates and working as a waiter at a tiny caf√©. It was a Saturday night, and I was working two ""four tops and two doubles"" for that shift. I was seated one of the duces with two women waiting to be told the specials, while I was up in the dessert & salad area. Another waiter on that shift came streaming into the area, saying ""Jay!, the two women at B1, they're from the movie!"" The previous week, a magazine article featuring great supporting actors that had made a lot of great movies. Frances got a full page among others. I had couple women only a week before ask me for a movie recommendation one week earlier, so being terribly busy at a shift, what came to mind was Blood Simple, which I had recently seen. My mind was think the one thing, repeat customers. So I approached the two and opened with: "" Hi, I'm Jay. soooo, did you like the movie I recommended?"" ""What movie was that"" was her friend's response. ""Blood Simple"" I said "" I haven't seen it yet, but she was in it"". she said. I was floored and embarrassed, but continued on with my job, ""Hi, I'm Frances, and this is my friend who's in theater here now"". They got on with their meal, we all smiled and laughed at the mixup. Great women. It gets weirder: When I got home, I proceeded to tell my roommate with the magazine about the fun meeting. He thought too great a story to believe, and asked if I wanted to have breakfast tomorrow with a friend of ours. Sure... OK The next morning we met for breakfast talking and who walks in, spots me, and says ""HI'. Frances. You can't imagine the look on those two guys when I introduced them to Fran McD. Probably all around the funniest set of circumstance and chance things in my years at the restaurant trade.","","Frances McDormand is one of the coolest people I have ever met...","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGRHA5LWDYJUYYDR6PFIQLFFZE2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T9X9K2QDM30B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

It‚Äôs a lifestyle chosen by some or it chooses them for whatever reason but this movie does tend to glamorize it. For some, it‚Äôs just an escape from something or just a lifestyle change that works for many who can feel trapped by things like a house, family, a steady job and/or friends, perhaps Fern just felt a sense of relief and freedom once she was alone and the place she had lived literally became unavailable to her. There have always been drifters and they drifted for many reasons by various means and I think this movie captured that and whatever you make this one out to be will likely have something to to with your current situation. I think for Fern it was about freedom and avoiding attachments that can quickly become anchors like living in a company town for many years like USG had in Nevada. We spent about a month crossing the country in a van looking for a new home in the west and we had a ton of tools, repair manuals, some spare parts and a generator just in case. I liked it, it kept my interest throughout and the scenery was great but I didn‚Äôt see it as a story of loss nor homelessness.","","It‚Äôs whatever you want it to be.","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHDUSIIVLBLVFWGMZRGCZDGFPB7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CQXIXMJ6RGAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

"B095322ZW8","Nomadland (4K UHD)","4.3","866","septimus","","Verified Purchase","","","","3.0","February 16, 2022","United States","I really don't care for the first part of Chloe Zhao's _Nomadland_. Most supporting characters are played by non-professionals. The problem there is that Zhao, like so many directors who use non-professional actors, feels obliged to present the views of these nomadic workers with excessive respect and intimacy, like every word is a priceless pearl of wisdom -- even when one of them has a Confederate flag tattoo on his arm (if memory serves)! The camera seems stuck to them head-on. It is hard not to make a comparison with the itinerant workers in _Days of Heaven_, which Terrence Malick depicts at a glancing angle, so the camera bounces off, keeping a phyiscal and emotional distance Unlike _Days_, there is no background music, no sense of awe, and _Nomadland_ seems an exercise in miserabilism. After the 35 minute mark, suddenly it is a completely different film. A soulful piano score permeates the second half (music is use too excessively and repetitively, in fact), David Strathairn shows up as a cook in a diner to give the story an anchor, and McDormand's character gets to stay with his family, her own family, and even to enjoy herself outdoors. There is even some cohesion to the visual motifs; a hollow rock, its lightness and airiness, is made to contrast with the back-breaking rock-hard potatoes she signs up to pack. There is also a philosophical touch about the origin of life in a dinosaur theme park. None of this is very original of course; the dinosaur extinction piece suffers from comparison with Romain Laguna's _Meteorites_, where it is the major leitmotif, and the camera work and art-house mannerism are nothing you haven't seen before. _Nomadland_ does not have the deeply personal, revelatory feel of, say, A.J. Edwards' work, never mind fellow female Marvel excursion helmer Cate Shortland's. Still, the second half by itself makes for an above average art film. Why create a film that is so uneven though? The most unusual thing about _Nomadland_ is the age of its female protagonist (McDormand is in her late 60s). In a way this celebration of a salt-of-the-earth type reminds me of David Lynch's _The Straight Story_, which generated its share of plaudits when it came out. And then ... nothing. I honestly haven't heard anyone mention this film in at least 15 years, despite Lynch's auteur status. _Nomadland_ has the distinct feel of a film given obligatory hype, but is doomed to be forgotten soon afterwards.","","Uneven; the second half is a decent art-house offering","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHPE7RLIQLVVCLXWBWPURAWBSECA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G0D607POHCKZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

It‚Äôs more a character study than plot, and mixes quiet stories both of real people and and the composite main character who seamlessly fits in with the others. As someone now around the age of Fern in this film, who during the past COVID year has realized both the incredible lack of safety nets available in this country during times of recession or serious illness (and being in the first generation facing elder years without pensions or adequate healthcare), at a time of life where personal losses and job discrimination steadily increase across socioeconomic classes, I was moved to see so much resilience and beauty in the very difficult lifestyle choices they made. The real stories added a lot. I have a friend who did live this van life for a decade before serious health issues set in and I know both how hard the life is and yet how connected they felt both to the land and fellow travelers. The travelers are mostly apolitical which I also really appreciated. No soapbox - just quietly understated journey. In the midst of personal loss this film filled me with hope and appreciation of the resilience and creativity we have to still make choices, and the ways even seemingly disconnected people still find connection and beauty in life.","","Beautiful film of resilience in the face of loss","162","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNQ3YZ7DNHGJPQEOA4FPLLFJMYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD860WQU16DOD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

It won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Director. üíúüé¨ I LOVED this movie!!! It is an in depth look at the life of a nomad. It's not an easy lifestyle by any means. The life is very lonely and full of heartache, but there is also so much beauty in it as well. Some people choose that life and some get scarily thrown into it by the downturn of life. I love road trips and being on my own so I have often thought about what it would be like to just live on the road for the rest of my life. There is so much beauty in the world. I think it would be so much nicer to spend your life being one with nature rather than working in a dead end job where you stare at the walls of a cubicle and know what to expect every day for the rest of your life. But there is so much to consider if you do choose that life and I don't quite have the courage and street smarts to pursue it full time. Plus I have never learned to drive and am so petrified of getting behind the wheel so I'm totally out. It's not the life for me. But I certainly am envious of people that have chosen to live this way. As for the ones that don't, my heart just breaks for them. It is really tough out there. I can't even imagine it. This movie was very well done. The screenplay is very good and the acting is so natural. But I think most of the people in this movie are real life nomads and not actors so that explains that. It is a movie, but sort of a documentary as well. I love actress Frances McDormand. She is always amazing. She is natural in whatever role she plays. I wish I could embody the characters as well as she does. I also loved seeing actor David Strathairn in this as well. He is so good and so warm and sweet in this movie. But I think the scenery is what really steals this movie. It is so beautiful. It makes me wish I were on a vacation right now. I am happy that I saw this in theatres. There was only one other person in there with me so it was like having the whole theatre to myself. I loved it! Go see it in theatres if you get a chance or I believe you can also rent it on demand for $5.99. üíúüöôüõ§üåÑüåÖüååüèû","","The Solitary And Beautiful Life Of A Nomad...","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJJ5JOCC4NIOIOZUCYMLJEBFHMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPXYWXVBYLM1T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

"B095322ZW8","Nomadland (4K UHD)","4.3","866","Spock","","Verified Purchase","","","","5.0","November 10, 2021","United States","This movie is a detailed portrait of a particular person and personality that can't settle down. Francis McDormand turns in another incredible acting job, much of which doesn't involve speaking. Her character keeps moving from job to job, place to place, making friends and facing struggles along the way. She just barely gets by as her body ages, living out of her car and working unforgiving jobs as the seasonal work calls for the next migration. I can't say I know why some people are like this, but I have known people who are like that, so it's real. Perhaps they can't or don't want to conform their conduct as necessary to live in long stable situations -- so its a life style based on a concept of personal freedom. Maybe each person has their own reasons. The movie is very ""small"" and detailed, and I would imagine to a typical movie audience, it could seem boring. But let yourself be drawn into it and open yourself to understanding the whys and wherefores of this lifestyle, and it is very powerful and raises some big questions about how most of us live our lives. It's interesting to see the kindness that folks in this ""community"" show to each other, and how little they can live with in terms of material possessions. Some of the actors are real people from the migrant/nomadic living community recruited for the movie. It added further power to the movie. It deserved the Oscars it won -- the big ones: best movie, best director, best actress.","","A fascinating portrait of a wandering soul","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCQWKQHAJKFXQ5W3YTTQCHAGUTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VFION182V7VF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

It does a nice job at showing the camper life and some beautiful areas of the country was well as nicely portraying the issues of losing someone, poverty and being homeless or at least being forced to live in a car, camper, etc. Unfortunately, it spends way too much time with long scenes of nothing but silence portraying the character‚Äôs lonely existence.

And it's loaded with the same tropes and clich√©s of numerous predecessors with the same moody cinematic blueprint. Mostly it is another perfectly cast vehicle for the star. I really liked that most of the actors were actual RV nomads. The star of this exquisitely filmed movie is Ms. McDormand's face. She needs to say little or nothing to convey a kaleidoscope of emotions. Everything about the movie says that it is, if not deep, at least poetically reflective. It has no major flaws nor any major epiphanies. My only quibbles are the following: there were about 3 too many scenes of McDormand's character walking about in the semi dark as piano and violin music played. The spirit of Shirley MacClaine and her books seemed to hover over this movie. Also, I am not sure why it annoyed me but the Amazon assembly line scenes struck me as some weird form of product placement, the product being Amazon itself. Sometimes a really well done movie pulls your strings for emotional reactions; this one tugs mightily but the material never rises to much more than a very familiar movie given rootsy credibility by its nomadic cast and its relevant subject matter.","","High Quality Art Film Drenched in the Expected Melancholia","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHO2JLOKEW2MUHAU4MC25COFYYJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R750K71XWJZR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

Their seamless interaction with the real nomads who give this film its boundless heart are shaped by the sensitive talents of director Chloe Zhao. She has given viewers to understand that these van campers are resourceful, respectful of nature and the law, and have chosen their lifestyle. Nomadland is a quiet film, tender and joyous and sad; in short, it is nakedly human. Evocative of the restive, independent spirit, and alluding to the myriad possible reasons for living on the move, Nomadland offers a word to the wise. One of its characters gently corrects someone who refers to her as homeless, saying, ""I'm not homeless, I just don't have a house.""","","A brilliant mix of documentary and fiction","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZYKFLHJGSKLHI3VGVFGZ65GOJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10GJYBJRVOT5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

What they talk about is all pretty miserable and depressing, from the death of loved ones to suffering from illness to being estranged, the movie does have a couple humorous or uplifting moments but they are overwhelmed by the former miserable tone. McDormand's performance is so-so, she mostly just stands around listening to people, and one of the trivia points outright admits that they had a different take on the character before McDormand joined, after which they rebuilt the character around her normal personality.

It's a lonesome road, one of fleeting connections and uncertain destinations; a solitary existence that's half choice and half necessity. I‚Äôve noticed a certain sense of daydreamy romanticism floating around this sort of lifestyle recently, the glamorized prospect of working from a cel signal with the great outdoors as a backdrop, but Nomadland strips away much of that veneer in showing the other side of the coin. There's promise in such freedom, but also great risk, and not every van lifer is cut out for the harsh realities of such a compartmentalized existence. Frances McDormand drew a best actress Oscar for her portrayal of Fern, the wandering protagonist whose compassion leads her to make deep connections with similar spirits, but whose withdrawn emotional restlessness forces those relationships to remain decidedly brief. She's wonderful, as expected, with an expressive authenticity that can make the film feel more like a documentary than a staged drama. Evidently, moviegoers weren't the only ones taken by that convincing act: without a firm script, much of the film's dialogue is delivered by true nomads who happened into the indie-scale production and, taking McDormand for one of their own, opened up to her. That knowledge can cause the film to teeter a bit too close to exploitation, but it also lends extra credibility and sentimental power to the viewing experience. Gloomy but stirring, with a potent contemporary subject, a number of rich supporting characters (if they're actually characters at all), a beautiful photographic sense and a smooth narrative flow. It‚Äôs a meaningful picture, if not an uplifting one.","","An Unflinching Portrayal of Life Among the Uprooted","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFO2RDMKUTXC3M7C3T2UVFANWQVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XTWXMHOZHLJF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

"B095322ZW8","Nomadland (4K UHD)","4.3","866","MK","TOP 500 REVIEWER","Verified Purchase","","","","5.0","October 09, 2021","Germany","Nach den Filmen ‚ÄûSongs My Brother Taught Me‚Äú (2015) und dem Arthouse-Hit ‚ÄûThe Rider‚Äú (2017) ist ‚ÄûNomadland‚Äú (2020) der dritte Film der in Peking geborenen Chlo√© Zhao (Jahrgang 1982). Er thematisiert Verlust und Trauer und schildert die Lebenssituation von Wanderarbeitern in den USA. Sie adaptierte dazu das 2017 ver√∂ffentlichte Sachbuchs der US-amerikanischen Autorin Jessica Bruder mit dem Titel ‚ÄûNomaden der Arbeit: √úberleben in den USA im 21. Jahrhundert‚Äú (im Original ‚ÄûNomadland: Surviving America In The Twenty-First Century‚Äú). Fern (Frances McDormand. z.B. ‚ÄûThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri‚Äú - 2017; ‚ÄûOlive Kitteridge‚Äú ‚Äì Miniserie 2014) verliert ihren Arbeitsplatz in einer Gipsplattenfabrik, als diese mangels Nachfrage schlie√üt. Mit der Firma verschwindet auch die Stadt ‚ÄûEmpire‚Äú von der Landkarte - ihre Postleitzahl wird einfach gestrichen. Um sich √ºber Wasser zu halten, f√§hrt die noch trauernde Witwe mit ihrem Van, in dem sie nun lebt, von Job zu Job und von Bundesstaat zu Bundesstaat: sie f√ºhrt das Leben einer Arbeitsnomadin. ‚ÄûNomadland‚Äú ist weniger Roadmovie als ‚ÄûStationenmovie‚Äú mit nahezu unauff√§lliger und damit umso gelungenerer Musikuntermalung, wobei die Musik aus Ludovico Einaudis Klavier-Zyklus und der siebenteiligen Albumsammlung ‚ÄûSeven Days Walking‚Äú aus dem Jahr 2019 stammt. Im Zentrum stehen die Hauptperson Fern sowie all die Menschen, denen sie - oft nur kurz- begegnet, und ihre Lebensgeschichten. √úber das Erz√§hlen von pr√§genden Ereignissen, h√§ufig sind es Schicksalsschl√§ge, von Erfahrungen, Empfindungen, Einstellungen, √∂ffnet sich die sehr in sich zur√ºckgezogene Fern allm√§hlich, sodass das Publikum auch √ºber sie mehr erf√§hrt. Frances McDormand verschmilzt auf gro√üartige Weise mit Fern, spielt sie so dezent verschlossen und zur√ºckhaltend, dass sie vor allem scheu und verletzlich wirkt, und wurde zu Recht mit einem Oscar als ‚ÄûBeste Hauptdarstellerin‚Äú ausgezeichnet. Dass neben ihr Laiendarsteller, ‚Äûechte Nomaden‚Äú, welche fiktive Versionen ihrer selbst spielen, agieren, bewirkt das Verwischen der Grenze zwischen Fakt und Fiktion und verleiht dem Film sein besonderes Flair mit viel Authentizit√§t und einen dokumentarisch-pers√∂nlichen, gesellschaftskritischen Anstrich. Dabei f√§llt die Sozialkritik in ‚ÄûNomadland‚Äú nicht offen aus, sondern subtil und still. Selbst wenn die Situation der Nomaden prek√§r ist, die Stellpl√§tze und das Klima oft unwirtlich, sie mit Weite und Leere, Einsamkeit, Kargheit und Knappheit, auch an Geld oder Vorr√§ten, konfrontiert werden, begegnen sie dem mit St√§rke, Widerstandskraft, W√ºrde, Humor, Warmherzigkeit, Ideenreichtum, Hilfsbereitschaft und sogar kindlicher Freude, gewinnen dem Leben in Freiheit als ‚ÄûLeben des amerikanischen Traums‚Äú positive Seiten ab, selbst wenn es sich zuweilen wie ein Gef√§ngnis anf√ºhlen d√ºrfte. Diese z√§rtlich mitf√ºhlende Schilderung schm√§lert das Bedr√ºckende, Triste, Trostlose, welches dem Film innewohnt. Als besonders eindrucksvoll empfand ich den Kontrast zwischen den beengten und begrenzten Lebensumst√§nden in Schmerz, H√§rte und Verzicht und der streckenweise √ºberw√§ltigend sch√∂nen, gro√üartigen, sehnsuchtsvollen Landschaft, die wie ein Heilmittel auf die verletzten Seelen zu wirken scheint. Res√ºmee: ‚ÄûNomadland‚Äú ist ein meisterhaft sanft erz√§hlter, anr√ºhrender, aber auch best√ºrzender und traurig machender Film, dessen Thematik, Darsteller, Bilder voller Kontraste, von kargen Stellpl√§tzen bis zu faszinierender Landschaft noch lange im Ged√§chtnis haften bleiben. Die Auszeichnungen mit dem ‚ÄûGoldenen L√∂wen‚Äú 2020 bei den Filmfestspielen von Venedig und den drei Oscars (‚ÄûBester Film‚Äú, ‚ÄûBeste Regie‚Äú, ‚ÄûBeste Hauptdarstellerin‚Äú) finde ich absolut verdient. PS: Beginnend in South Dakota im September 2018 reiste die 36-k√∂pfige Crew im weiteren Verlauf f√ºr die Dreharbeiten √ºber sechs Monate durch Nebraska, Nevada, Kalifornien und Arizona. In China wurde √ºber die Oscarauszeichnung des Films nicht berichtet, Beitr√§ge in chinesischen sozialen Medien wurden zensiert.","","Leise, melancholische Reise","8","","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

I was unable to get a good picture. Upon querying Amazon chat for a refund (I was beyond the 48 hour refund window as I had gone out of town), I was accused of having streamed the movie (and, by implication, of having watched it and lied about needing a refund).

This film is an extraordinary look into the heart -soul of a woman who lost her life partner. The movie doesn't go further into stating why the character Fern (Frances McDormand) chose to hit the open road, living a nomad life, therefore, the only assumption that could be made is she needed to work through, heal the parts of her after the loss of her husband. This movie feels like a warm smiling stranger that you meet on the road and over coffee, they share with you their life's many journeys. The movie is beautifully shot with many poignant, raw, moments that had me shedding a tear. Frances McDormand is absolutely a gift to her craft and made this movie the beautiful piece of art in cinema that it is. So pour yourself a cup of coffee, wine, or whatever and settle into this one. It will leave you thinking about leaving all the social constructs of society behind and allowing yourself to explore the multitude of beauty that life has to offer once you allow yourself to actually see it.

I had no idea there was a community of people like this living a nomad life but it makes sense. To me this was a story of resilience and adaptation that was really inspiring. I read that most people in the movie were not actors but actual nomads. The character suffers a devastating life change but still finds a way to connect with a community of people and experience happiness and meaning in her life. She just does what she needs to do in order to survive. She doesn‚Äôt complain or blame, she creates a different kind of life for herself.

Zwischendurch nimmt sie Jobs an und lernt au√üerdem viele Menschen kennen, die ebenfalls als Nomaden durch die USA unterwegs sind. Der Film ist eine Adaption des Sachbuchs ‚ÄûNomaden der Arbeit: √úberleben in den USA im 21. Jahrhundert.‚Äú Der Film ist quasi eine Art Roadmovie, welcher uns einen Einblick in das Nomadenleben in den USA gew√§hrt. Die Nomaden sind unter anderem inspiriert vom Bob Wells, welcher einen Youtube Kanal √ºber nomadischen Lebensstil und ‚Äûvandwelling‚Äú macht. Dieser Bob Wells spielt √ºbrigens in dem Film sich selbst. Was uns auch schon direkt zum n√§chsten Punkt f√ºhrt: Den Darstellern. Die meisten ‚ÄûDarsteller‚Äú spielen tats√§chlich sich selbst, bzw. eine fiktive Version von sich selbst. Die professionell besetzten Rollen sind eher in der Minderheit. Dies tut der augenscheinlichen Authentizit√§t auch ziemlich gut, denn die ganzen Nebencharaktere kommen ziemlich glaubw√ºrdig und interessant r√ºber. Tats√§chlich w√ºrde ich gerade diese Darsteller als Schauspielerisches Highlight des Filmes nennen, ich pers√∂nlich fand die Nebendarsteller authentischer und auch interessanter als der eigentliche Hauptcharakter. Interessant finde ich auch zu erw√§hnen, dass die Regisseurin selbst auf einen Roadtrip begab um die Community ‚Äì und auch den Lebensstil besser kennen zu lernen. Zur augenscheinlichen Authentizit√§t ‚Äì der Film wirkte auf mich glaubw√ºrdig in der Darstellung und hat gut darin getan, dem Zuschauer einen Einblick ‚Äì in eine f√ºr die meisten ‚Äì ungew√∂hnliche Realit√§t zu gew√§hren ‚Äì die f√ºr viele vermutlich heute so gar nicht vorstellbar ist, aber durchaus existiert. Aber ich habe mich mit der Thematik selbst nicht ausf√ºhrlich besch√§ftigt und habe selbst noch keine Nomaden kennen gelernt, oder versucht so zu leben. Von daher kann ich nat√ºrlich keine Aussage dar√ºber treffen, in wie fern der Film nun das Leben dieser Menschen authentisch darstellt oder nicht ‚Äì aber es wirkte zumindest so. Wundersch√∂n ist auch die √Ñsthetik des Filmes, sch√∂ne Bilder. Mit einer tollen Kameraf√ºhrung, die exzellent mit der gro√üartigen Musik von Ludovico Einaudi harmoniert. Insgesamt finde ich den Film gut und w√ºrde ihn mit 3,5 Sternen bewerten ‚Äì warum? Das kann ich gar nicht so genau sagen und es gibt auch keine offensichtlichen Schw√§chen, aber der Film hat mich jetzt nicht so sehr begeistert, dass ich eine h√∂here Bewertung rechtfertigen k√∂nnte, oder die Oscar Auszeichnung als ‚Äûbester Film‚Äú nachvollziehen k√∂nnte. Insgesamt ein sehr interessanter, √§sthetischer Film, aber meines Erachtens auch nicht einer der besten Filme aller Zeiten.","","Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.

"B095322ZW8","Nomadland (4K UHD)","4.3","866","Turfseer","","","","","","2.0","May 02, 2021","United States","Warning: Spoilers Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0 I saw director Chloe Zhao's first two films at Spirit Award screenings in 2015 and 2017 and that time complained that they were both lugubrious with paltry plotting. I am sad to report that despite displaying her consistent technical prowess as a director, Zhao still is unable to come up with a clever story that hits all the marks for a successful three act screenplay. Based on a non-fiction book of the same name by Jessica Bruder, Zhao taped interviews with various ""Nomads"" (self-described as ""houseless"" as opposed to ""homeless"" by the film's protagonist, Fern, played by Frances McDormand), and incorporated some of their stories into the film. Some of the actual non-actor Nomads Zhao interviewed are cast in the film and perhaps provide the most colorful moments as we follow the protagonist's journey. The plot focuses on Fern, who after losing her job as a result of the 2008 economic downturn (the gypsum plant she worked at closes) decides to put most of her possessions in storage and go on the road, living out of a run-down camper. It's noted that the town where she's from-Empire, Nevada-faces a mass exodus of its inhabitants, eventually leading to the elimination of the town's zip code from the postal service directory. To add insult to injury, shortly before she goes on the road, Fern's husband passes away, leaving her at first bewildered, only to take solace later on by embracing (by what some may call) ""rugged individualism."" We learn that because the Nomads are unable to subsist on their social security checks alone, they're forced to take seasonal employment to support themselves. Thus we follow Fern first as she takes a job at an Amazon Fulfillment Center and later other jobs including a camp host at the Cedar Pass Campground in Badlands National Park, a restaurant job in South Dakota and later at a sugar beet processing plant. As we keep following Fern, we're introduced to various real-life characters such as Bob Wells, a sort of self-help guru for the Nomad community, who runs a desert rendezvous in Arizona. Wells proves to be an interesting father figure to the community but has little to do with the plot involving Fern, possibly with the exception of a heartfelt conversation they have together at film's end in which he reveals the pain he experienced following his adult son's suicide. Less successful in terms of developing Fern's story, is a subplot involving another nomad, Swankie, who's facing a cancer diagnosis and decides not to spend her last days in a hospital and instead to go on one last vacation (it should be noted that Swankie's cancer is a standard fictional construct and Zhao uses it to manipulate our emotions-a completely unnecessary strategy given the rich backstories of the various real-life nomads). The Nomadland plot basically revolves around whether Fern decides to continue on the road or not. There's the friendship with Dave (David Strathairn) who eventually opts to stay with his son and daughter-in-law who have a new baby. Toward the end of the film Fern visits Dave at the son's house but declines to accept his invitation to live there in a guest house. Perhaps the crisis of the second Act is when Fern's camper breaks down and she's forced to take a bus to California to borrow money for repairs from her sister. All's well that ends well when the sister obligingly gives her the needed funds. The scene with the sister is indicative of Zhao's persistent desire to idealize her protagonist's situation-the worst the sister can say to Fern is that she was always ""eccentric""-nonetheless, she praises her, again for the previously alluded to ""rugged individualism."" In a sense, Fern is the updated version of the ""noble savage."" In the days when Native Americans were castigated as savages, there was (if I may utilize a Freudian term here), a reaction formation in which certain writers in the 19th century went to the opposite extreme and depicted them as uncorrupted outsiders, emphasizing an innate, essential goodness. The same could be said for certain individuals today of a more liberal, progressive bent who seek to help the ""homeless"" in all ways possible, ignoring other aspects of their self-destructive behavior and threat they may present to the social order. Indeed we only see Fern get angry once (when Dave breaks some of her dishes by accident) and the reality of community opposition to the nomad lifestyle is only hinted at occasionally. When Fern clings to her camper and refuses to sell it because she's constructed it as a special ""home away from home,"" it becomes painfully obvious that her possessiveness is akin to a tried and true hoarder which many of us are familiar with from a fairly well known cable TV program. Indeed the unhealthy interior of the camper is only hinted at also occasionally (Fern complains about ants in the van as well as having to relieve herself once into a bucket after experiencing a bad reaction to something she eats). Ultimately Zhao leans a little too much toward idealizing her protagonist and unfortunately McDormand can do little with a script that emphasizes a monochromatic personality. Fern is simply bland and seems to relish in avoiding conflict. And that's what Nomadland perhaps lacks the most: conflict! In the end, Zhao has her heroine Fern returning to the road, afraid to suggest that maybe everything is not peachy keen in Nomadland. Despite some beautiful cinematography and use of music, Zhao appears content to remain in her indie niche, lucky to win an Oscar for Best Picture but probably the last time that will occur.","","Underdeveloped plot (once again) highlights indie director's idealized portrait of nomadic lifestyle","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGB73EWCWDLMD6VR5YT25WLQQPAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=75&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS2YGCXG1LE6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

The film takes a slice of something uniquely American with rich interesting real-life drama to mine from; namely, van life, and misses all of it.

This same depressing character is the same as in the past films, except it's with the nice lady from Fargo, who somehow, unfathomably, has become unlikeable by the end.

It is a story of people who live in vans and travel from city to city getting jobs to survive and then move on again. It tells how they create a community of like minded travelers. But that is where the movie ends being well made. Most of the movie is done in the dark. One scene started in daylight, and by the time the main actor walked over to another traveler, it turned to dusk instantly. Too much darkness in the scenes. The other problem I had was loud piano music in background which often drowned out the dialog. In frustration, I was forced to use the subtitles because I couldn't hear what the actors were saying due to the loud background music.

Did I learn anything new from it that I had not known before? Did any of the characters resonate with me with his/her situation being particularly unique and insightful? On all these fronts the movie came up short. I quickly forgot about the movie as soon as I finished it. I tried to keep asking what was the point of the film. Is it that even though we try to escape the hardships and trappings of society, we cannot escape them, as the past is constantly haunting us? Or is it that we all are vulnerable to the system (reliance on Amazon etc) even though we try to free ourselves from it? Even if either one was the theme of the film, the exploration of it was not done in any penetrating manner. Technically also I found the film to be somewhat disjointed. I think the director could have done a much better job in turning this into a documentary instead of creating a feature film. I was also surprised that Frances McDormand won an Oscar for her role in the movie. Actually there's not much to act in her role. It was a far cry from her performance in Fargo which was truly outstanding. All in all, I had been looking for a more compelling, powerful or nuanced film given all the hype about it.

This movie hit the spot for me. Life has been one upheaval after another since the pandemic started. The RV Nomad lifestyle is not for everyone. So the ones who gave this movie a bad review probably don't get it or do not understand the draw to this sort of life. And that is totally ok. Me, I don't have to worry about saving for retirement; I have discovered that I have lived my life as if I WAS retired. Personal experience has shown me that if I have a full tank of gas, great soundtrack and a freeway sign I'm GAWN! This movie is an encouragement AND a comfort to me during this weird time in history.

Fern drives around from town to town with the same dumb look on her face. It's all about her and there isn't any character development. Maybe if the movie had started while the husband was still alive it could have added some badly needed depth, but you might as well watch a couple episodes of the old Kung Fu series with David Carradine rather than watch this is you want to see a nomad wonder the desert, at least they had plots. Yet it won best movie and people obviously thought it was wonderful so there must be something there I'm not getting. Maybe the people that like it could identify with the character, I could not.

Some for adventure, companionship, others for the purpose of sole survival. You will be taken out of the comfort of your couch, to go on a road trip with the protagonist an aging woman that lost her home and previous life through no fault of her own. This movie is well shot and shows a realistic side of our society that seems to fail a growing number of people. The protagonists share their life with you in a part road movie, part documentary. It showcases some realistic live stories and provides a social commentary on consumerism and the disconnect of social norms to the need of many. The growing movement of nomad living that has become a chosen lifestyle for many and the Guru of Cheap RV living Bob Wells is shown in the movie, talking about his life and the life of his friends and fellow comrades. This movie is well done, worth seeing and gives a great insight into the American life outside of desperate housewife drama and celebrity fashion news. This is a portrait of our soul as a nation, the change of landscape in this vast large country, and the diverse ways in which people from all walks of life make a living. Not all fit the norm, for some its a needed escape from the rat race, for others its a freedom of self expression. Some are seeking healing in nature. All have a reason to call the open road home. It is one of the most important movies to watch. It is humble, without moral overtone and shows us a view that we might have missed otherwise. Beautifully done, worth every second of your time. No special effects, no car chases, no sex, no violence - just great storytelling from a compelling vantage point.","","A realistic dense look in to the American reality","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHRKZGSA4U7E7N3VSKNZOLDZAG2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B095322ZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=79&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Frances McDormand","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NVFLTTJWXRXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095322ZW8","https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Frances-McDormand/dp/B095322ZW8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nomadland&qid=1664326384&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi43MSIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Nomadla%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-4"

Nel 1988, la fabbrica presso cui Fern ed il marito Bo hanno lavorato tutta la vita, ha chiuso i battenti, anche Bo se n'√® andato, dopo una lunga malattia e Fern si ritrova a vivere in un furgone, trasformato in casa e riempito delle poche cose da cui non riesce a separarsi. Fern si mantiene facendo lavori saltuari, non avendo diritto ai sussidi statali e non avendo pi√π l'et√† per riciclarsi in un paese in crisi. Comincia cos√¨ a spostarsi da un luogo all'altro dell'America, nomade per necessit√† e non per scelta. Attraverso il ritratto di una donna in perpetuo movimento, la regista ( cinese di nascita) racconta l'America dei grandi spazi e la solidariet√† fra coloro che si ritrovano ai margini, in questo caso a causa di un welfare e di un sistema sanitario inesistenti. Il film ha vinto 3 premi Oscar, di cui uno, meritatissimo, alla protagonista Frances McDormand. Molto triste, ma assolutamente da vedere, ovviamente in lingua originale.
